# CHANGELOG

## 2026-09-01 (later still) — Phase-residualisation choice is now self-documenting

`PHASE_RESIDUALISE = 'cosine_2h'` was justified from a run on the old 8-recday
set, and the justification lived only in a comment. It is now RECOMPUTED EVERY
RUN: `PHASE_BASES_TO_COMPARE = ['cosine', 'cosine_2h']` sends each basis through
the same `run_all_recdays` -> `methods_results_stats` path as the primary
analysis, prints a read-out, and writes
`key_analysis_stats.json['phase_residualisation_comparison']` with the
criterion stated in the file. Costs one extra full pass per non-default basis.

Criterion (fixed in advance): use the basis that removes the Subgoal Progress
effect, since subgoal progress dominates this dataset and any residue would
inflate the action-plan fit.

Re-tested on the full 25 recdays / 7 mice — the original conclusion holds:

| basis     | analysis      | Subgoal Progress beta | t(23) | q_FDR    | sig |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|-------|----------|-----|
| cosine    | full_z        | +0.0495               | +5.40 | 1.2e-05  | YES |
| cosine    | across_halves | +0.0593               | +3.26 | 2.3e-03  | YES |
| cosine_2h | full_z        | -0.0229               | -5.82 | 1.00     | no  |
| cosine_2h | across_halves | -0.0520               | -3.60 | 0.999    | no  |

A single harmonic leaves a significant positive subgoal-progress effect; two
harmonics remove it. Rodent phase tuning (von Mises, kappa = 3.33) is sharp
enough to carry second-harmonic structure that one harmonic leaves behind.

Important for the manuscript: the choice does NOT manufacture the main effect.
Action Plan is essentially unchanged either way — full_z 0.2259 (t = 9.23) with
'cosine' vs 0.2324 (t = 9.57) with 'cosine_2h'; across-halves 0.2820 (t = 6.73)
vs 0.2964 (t = 7.21). All significant at q < 1e-5.

Caveat to state honestly: 'cosine_2h' does not leave Subgoal Progress at zero,
it leaves it reliably NEGATIVE (t(23) = -5.82). The one-sided criterion "not
significantly positive" is met, but describing it as "null" is inaccurate — it
is better described as over-corrected. Worth pre-empting, since a reviewer can
read it as over-residualisation.

## 2026-09-01 (later) — Full OSF release downloaded + uniform self-normalisation

The authors have now confirmed that **the normalisation they settled on is not
the one published** in `Basic_analysis.ipynb`, and it has not been shared. That
closes the earlier puzzle: the published `raw_to_norm` reproduces their released
`Neuron_*` arrays only to r ~ 0.88 because it is a different method, not because
we were running it wrong. Their released normalised files are therefore
unreproducible, and the only self-consistent option is to normalise everything
ourselves with one function.

**Downloaded (OSF 3d9r2):** all 25 combined ABCD recdays, 7 mice
(ab03, ah03, ah04, ah07, me08, me10, me11), 193 sessions, ~2.0 GB of
`Neuron_raw` / `Location_raw` / `trialtimes` / `Task_data`. Was 8 recdays /
5 mice. ab03 and ah07 are entirely new — they do not exist in the Drive share.

**New: `scripts/normalise_rodent_ephys.py`** + `raw_to_norm`, `normalise_segment`,
`state_boundaries` in `mc.analyse.analyse_ephys_clean`. Transcribed from the
authors' published `partition`/`normalise`/`raw_to_norm`. Output:
`derivatives/normalised_loc-max_<timestamp>/`, with a manifest and a settings
JSON recording every parameter and per-session shape. The raw release is never
modified.

    25 recdays / 7 mice / 193 sessions / 1252 neurons, 0 NaNs, all (n, trials, 360)

**Bug found and fixed in applying their code to Location.** Their `normalise`
stretches a state segment shorter than 90 raw bins by `np.repeat(x,10)/10`. The
`/10` is correct for a firing RATE and wrong for a categorical node ID — it
turns node 7 into 0.7. Their released `Location_*` arrays hold clean integers,
so they clearly do not divide there. `normalise_segment` now takes
`rate_scaled`, defaulting to True for 'mean' and False otherwise. Affects 1.12%
of state segments (109/9720) across 38 sessions; exact-bin agreement with the
released Location files rose 92.3% -> 93.9%.

**Undocumented choice, flagged:** the statistic for Location is not stated
anywhere by the authors. `--location-statistic` defaults to `max` (their
`take_max` option, and the only semantically sound one for node IDs). Agreement
with their released files: median 93.3%, max 92.3%, min 93.0%, mean 88.3% — no
statistic reproduces them, consistent with their method differing. Worth
confirming with them.

**CORRECTION to the earlier entry today.** The three "orphan" normalised
sessions (`ah04_05122021_06122021_3`, `ah04_09122021_10122021_3`,
`me10_09122021_10122021_8`) were downloaded and turn out to be **empty arrays**,
shape `(0,)`. So they were a genuine bad-session flag after all, just encoded as
an empty file rather than a missing one — the previous 61-session analysis was
correct and nothing was being wrongly discarded. `cross_view_session_ids` now
drops sessions that are absent OR empty in either view, so both encodings are
caught.

**`analysis_rodents_complete_clean.py`:** new `NORM_FOLDER` setting (now pointed
at the run above); the recday list is taken from whichever source supplies the
normalised view, so the analysis widens to 25 recdays automatically.
`load_ephys_data` gained `norm_folder`. Also added a **within-mouse robustness
test**: per-recday betas averaged within animal, then run through the IDENTICAL
`methods_results_stats` path (same one-sided t-test, same BH-FDR), written to
`key_analysis_stats.json` as `full_z_by_mouse` / `across_halves_by_mouse`.

Not yet re-run: all previously reported rodent numbers are from the authors'
normalised files at n = 8 recdays / 5 mice and are superseded.

Low-yield recdays to keep an eye on when the results land:
`me10_20122021_21122021` has 1 neuron and `me10_17122021_19122021` has 6, so
their per-recday betas will be very noisy.

## 2026-09-01 — Rodent data: the full release is on OSF, not the Drive share

New: `scripts/download_rodent_ephys_data.py` — per-file downloader (never
builds the multi-GB archive that makes the web download crash), verifies each
file with `np.load`, retries with back-off, resumes after a crash.

**Two sources, and they are not the same dataset.**

| | recdays | mice | raw | normalised 360-bin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OSF `3d9r2` (public release) | 25 | 7 | yes | **no** |
| private Google Drive share   | 14 | 5 | yes | yes, for 8 recdays |

Our 8 recdays came from the Drive. A recday is `{mouse}_{day1}_{day2}` — a
recording UNIT (two days spike-sorted together, 6 task configs), not an animal;
the 8 are ah03 x1, ah04 x3, me08 x1, me10 x1, me11 x2 = **8 recdays / 5 mice**.
The analysis docstring previously implied 8 animals; corrected, and
`key_analysis_stats.json` now carries a `settings.sample` block with
`n_recdays`, `n_mice`, `recdays_per_mouse`.

**Missing: 17 recdays, ~2.0 GB, including two entire mice.** `ab03` (3 recdays)
and `ah07` (3 recdays) are absent from the Drive share altogether. On disk vs on
OSF, per mouse: ab03 0/3, ah03 1/2, ah04 3/5, ah07 0/3, me08 1/3, me10 1/4,
me11 2/5. Five of the 25 (`combined_ABCDonly_notone_days.npy`) were recorded
without the state tones — a different sensory regime, kept separable via
`--tone-only`.

**Blocker on using them: OSF ships raw only.** The DSR analysis runs on the
normalised view (n_neurons x n_trials x 360, 90 bins/state), which OSF does not
include.

The authors' normalisation code IS public — `raw_to_norm` / `normalise` in
`Basic_analysis.ipynb` cell 21 of github.com/mohamadyelgaby/mFC_schema:

    Trial_times_conc = np.hstack((np.concatenate(tt[:,:-1]), tt[-1,-1])) // 25
    segments  = partition(raw_neuron, Trial_times_conc)      # one per state
    per_state = binned_statistic(arange(L), seg, 'mean', bins=90)[0]
                # with: if len(seg) < 90 -> seg = np.repeat(seg,10)/10 first
    Neuron_norm = per_state.reshape(n_states//4, 360)        # NO smoothing
                # (smoothing_sigma=10 applies only to raw_to_norm(return_mean=True))

Running it verbatim still does NOT reproduce the shipped `Neuron_*` files.
Over 18 sessions from 6 recdays: **mean r = 0.877** (range 0.75-0.97) for
neurons, **0.785** for locations, **zero exact matches**, and the trial count is
off by one in 8/18 sessions.

Cross-checked against OSF, not just the Drive: `Neuron_raw`, `Location_raw` and
`trialtimes` for ah03_18082021_19082021 (sessions 0, 2) and me08_10092021_11092021
(sessions 0, 2) are BIT-IDENTICAL between the two sources, and re-running the
authors' code on the freshly downloaded OSF raw gives exactly the same r
(0.8605 / 0.8050 / 0.9088 / 0.9648). So the mismatch is not a Drive-vs-OSF
artefact — the released raw is the same everywhere, and it still is not the
array that produced the released normalised files.

Why it cannot match: the bin values are exact rationals whose NUMERATORS agree
with ours but whose DENOMINATORS do not. For ah03_18082021_19082021_0, trial 0,
bin 0 the shipped value is 11/13 = `raw[5:18].mean()`, while their code on the
shipped raw gives 11/9 = `raw[0:9].mean()`. Same spikes, wider window, offset
start. I.e. **the published `Neuron_raw` is not the exact array that was fed to
`raw_to_norm`** — there is an alignment/binning difference upstream of the
released files. The off-by-one trial counts point the same way. So the recipe is
recoverable; the authors' exact output is not.

Consequence: do NOT mix the authors' normalised arrays for the old 8 with a
home-made version for the new 17 — the preprocessing difference lines up
exactly with the mouse/recday split and would confound the group test. Rebuild the normalised view from raw
for ALL 25 recdays with the `raw_to_norm` recipe above — that is now the only
self-consistent option, since the authors' own output cannot be reproduced.

**Fixed (Drive, changes results): 3 orphan normalised sessions restored.**
`Location/Neuron_ah04_05122021_06122021_3`, `..._ah04_09122021_10122021_3` and
`..._me10_09122021_10122021_8` existed on the Drive but had never been
downloaded. `cross_view_session_ids` drops sessions absent from the normalised
view assuming absence is the authors' implicit "bad session" flag; for these
three it was a download gap, so they were being discarded for no reason.
Downloaded 2026-09-01. Session counts now:

    ah04_05122021_06122021   7 -> 8
    ah04_09122021_10122021   7 -> 8
    me10_09122021_10122021   8 -> 9

Raw and normalised session lists now agree exactly for all 8 recdays (64
sessions, 504 neurons), i.e. the cross-view gate is currently a no-op. **The
analysis must be re-run — every number from before 2026-09-01 was computed on
61 sessions.**

Note on where raw is used: with `run_continuous: False` (the setting in
`analysis_rodents_complete_clean.py`) the raw branch of `process_one_recday` is
skipped entirely, so no reported result is computed from the raw files. They are
loaded only to build the `cross_view_session_ids` gate.

Indexing notes: gdown cannot enumerate the Drive folder (Google's folder HTML
caps at 50 entries per folder, the folder has 5037 files) — the script scrapes
`embeddedfolderview` instead. OSF is walked via its public API and cached as
`_osf_index.json`.

## 2026-08-29 — fMRI RSA: collinearity between the model RDMs of `DSR-contr_except_prev_but`

New: `scripts/plot_model_RDM_correlations.py` + `mc.plotting.results.plot_model_correlation_matrix_pub`.
Correlates the *model* RDMs of one combo GLM with each other (design
collinearity check for the RSA), and plots them as a 4 x 4 cm publication panel.

The model RDMs are built with the SAME code path as the searchlight RSA
(`pair_correct_tasks` -> per-model metric -> upper triangle, `diagonal_included:
false`), and, because the config sets `masked_conds: true`, restricted to the
same RDM cells the GLM is fit on — `make_category_masks(...,
mask_only_path_rew_combos=True)` keeps only same-type pairs (path-path and
reward-reward): 1,560 of 3,160 cells. No cells are dropped anywhere else.

Combo `DSR-contr_except_prev_but` (`rsa_config_quarters_DSR_controls.json`,
EVs `DSR_loc-fut-rews-state-dur-type`), n = 32 subjects with a local EV pickle,
group value = Fisher-z mean of the per-subject Pearson r:

|              | DSR   | location | A-state | l2_norm | next_buttons |
|--------------|-------|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| location     |  .531 |          |         |         |              |
| A-state      | -.009 |  -.024   |         |         |              |
| l2_norm      |  .294 |   .570   |  -.018  |         |              |
| next_buttons |  .269 |   .199   |  -.014  |  .265   |              |
| buttons_out  |  .269 |   .163   |   .015  |  .224   |  .162        |

SD across subjects <= .054 everywhere, i.e. the design geometry is essentially
identical in every subject. Highest collinearity is location <-> l2_norm (.57)
and DSR <-> location (.53) — both expected (the DSR is built from the location
vectors; l2_norm is a graded version of location). A-state is orthogonal to
everything (|r| <= .024).

## 2026-08-29 — mid-HC diagnosis: the "future-only" DSR is not a separate test, and the location result is a control-stack artefact

Diagnostic pass on `DSR_RSA_simple_ROI/2026-08-27_19-18-20` (latest),
`2026-07-30_15-58-51-fixed_cells-fixed_perms` and `2026-07-30_11-11-36`, to
resolve why mid HC carries the strongest concurrent-future β (Fig 2d) while its
cells are tuned to now / just-past (Fig 3c). No new runs; all numbers read from
stored results.

### 1. `dsr_fmri_fut` is a re-run of `dsr_fmri`, not an independent test

On the 4,560 valid RDM cells (HC_mid, `split_halves_z` mask):

    corr(dsr_fmri, dsr_fmri_fut) = 0.980

Dropping lag 0 removes 1 of 12 lag-windows from a Hamming distance over the
rolled 144-int trajectory, so the geometry barely moves. Consequences visible
in both runs: `ctrl_dsrFULL` and `ctrl_dsrFUT` return **identical p_perm to 3
dp** for every ROI (mPFC .022/.022, mOFC .866/.866, PCC .666/.666, HC_ant
.103/.103, HC_mid .001/.001) and identical control βs to 4 dp.

Also, lags 1 and 11 (30°, 330°) coincide with the current location on 39% of
bins (the autocorrelation figure already in Methods), so "future only" still
contains the present. **`ctrl_dsrFUT` cannot be cited as evidence that mid HC
codes the future.** Either drop it or replace it with a genuinely disjoint
model (e.g. lags 3–9 only).

Related: `corr(dsr_fmri, location) = 0.408` but `corr(dsr_fmri_fut, location) =
0.218` — dropping lag 0 does halve the location confound, yet the HC_mid β only
moves 0.073 → 0.068. So the mid-HC effect is not simply location leaking in
through lag 0.

### 2. The lag decomposition resolves the Fig 2d / Fig 3c tension

Joint quarter fit, `ctrl_dsrQUARTERS` in `2026-07-30_11-11-36` (4 quarters
compete against each other plus location + bttn_curr). Quarter k = lags
{3k, 3k+1, 3k+2}, i.e. curr = 0–60°, next = 90–150°, next2 = 180–240°,
next3 = 270–330°:

| ROI | curr | next | next2 | next3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mPFC | .021 (p=.298) | .003 (p=.626) | .021 (p=.204) | .031 (p=.104) |
| mOFC | .012 (p=.155) | −.020 | .005 | −.005 |
| PCC | .021 (p=.200) | −.053 | −.005 | **.048 (p=.005)** |
| HC_anterior | **.074 (p=.001)** | −.013 | .003 | .011 (p=.294) |
| HC_mid | .046 (p=.059) | .020 (p=.243) | .010 (p=.477) | **.073 (p=.001)** |

Single-model (no controls, latest run) shows the same shape for HC_mid:
curr .076 (p=.001), next .033 (p=.026), next2 .026 (p=.054), next3 .088 (p=.001).

**There is no contradiction.** Each quarter correlates 0.607 with the full DSR
by construction, so a region that matches on 2 of 4 quarters yields a large
full-DSR β. Mid HC's fit is carried by the two quarters flanking the present
(now and just-past) — exactly the cell-level profile (0°, p=.0131; 330°,
p=.0449). Anterior HC is purely present. The full-DSR regressor simply cannot
report which lags carry it.

### 3. Caveat: the decomposition does NOT confirm the mPFC 30/60° peak

`dsr_fmri_informed` (lags 1,2 = 30°+60°, the pre-registered mPFC window) in
`ctrl_dsrInformed`: mPFC β = +0.0196, **p = 0.130 (n.s.)**, while HC_anterior
β = +0.0557 (p=.001) and HC_mid β = +0.0436 (p=.006). This is because
`informed` correlates 0.873 with `curr_quarter` and 0.187 with `location` — it
is largely a near-present model, which is why the hippocampi load on it.

mPFC's DSR fit sits numerically in the later quarters (next2 p=.078, next3
p=.072 single-model; next3 p=.104 joint) but nothing survives. With n = 65 mPFC
cells this may be power, but at the RDM level the mPFC lag profile does **not**
independently reproduce the cell-level 30/60° result. This should be stated
rather than glossed — it is the weak point Jensen and Dorrell will find.

### 4. The mid-HC location effect is a control-stack artefact, not a data change

Same run, same cells (`2026-07-30_15-58-51-fixed_cells-fixed_perms`), location
as the read-out sub-model:

| combo | members | HC_mid | HC_ant |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ctrl_dsrFULL` | state, location, bttn_curr, dsr_fmri | **+.0330 (p=.025)** | **+.0403 (p=.009)** |
| `fmri_ctrl_dsrFULL` | + **l2_norm, bttn_next** | +.0145 (p=.223) | +.0356 (p=.040) |

Latest run carries only the second stack: HC_mid +.0153 (p=.215), HC_ant
+.0330 (p=.052).

**The culprit is `l2_norm`**: `corr(location, l2_norm) = 0.588`. It is a second
parameterisation of the same variable (graded negative distance to each of 9
grid locations vs categorical location). Singly in HC_mid: location .0643
(p=.001), l2_norm .0631 (p=.002) — near-identical. Jointly they split the
variance and neither clears.

Not a data change: the 07-31 and 08-27 runs return the same numbers despite
HC_mid n going 143 → 145, and 07-30's `fmri_ctrl_dsrFULL` (+.0145) matches
08-27's `ctrl_fMRI-state_dsrFULL` (+.0153).

**Manuscript consequence.** Fig 3g's caption describes exactly `ctrl_dsrFULL`
("controlling for future locations, position in sequence and current actions")
— no l2_norm, no next button — while Fig 2d uses the stack that includes them.
The two figures therefore use different control models, and the location claim
survives only under the leaner one. Options, in order of preference:

  (b) Test `location` + `l2_norm` jointly as one spatial-code contrast rather
      than pitting two parameterisations of one variable against each other.
      Correct given r = 0.59, and removes the arbitrariness.
  (a) Harmonise on the full stack and report mid HC as n.s. (p=.215), ant HC
      marginal (p=.052). The present-coding claim then rests on the cell-level
      result and on the quarter split (HC_ant curr p=.001, HC_mid next3
      p=.001), which is stronger evidence anyway.
  (c) Drop l2_norm from the location model only — hard to justify while it
      stays in the DSR model.

### Next step

`ctrl_dsrQUARTERS` is currently commented out in `RSA_DSR_ROIs_simple.py`
(combo_models). The joint quarter numbers above come from the pre-relabelling
cell set (mOFC 85 vs 74, HC_ant 162 vs 171, HC_mid 143 vs 145), so it needs a
re-run on the current cells before it can go in the paper. That single figure
answers [79], [102], [85], [107] and [109] in the co-author comments.


## 2026-08-28 (night) — `within_only` scope: the right fix for the instruction question

The user's suggestion -- drop the across-half block entirely -- is better than
the block nuisance regressor, and it is now implemented as
`data_rdm_scope = "within_only"`.

**Why it removes the artefact structurally.** The bias came from a similarity
offset BETWEEN the within-half and across-half blocks (data: 0.828 vs 0.863
dissimilarity, within < across in 89% of searchlights) which the instruction
regressors encode (r = +0.42 to +0.54 with an across-half indicator). Keep only
within-half cells and that contrast does not exist, so no regressor can absorb
it. Unlike the nuisance regressor, nothing has to be modelled away.

**It keeps the contrast the design was built for.** Of the 90 within-half
cells, 10 are same-task-letter pairs (the two directions of one task inside one
half). On exactly those cells the instruction dissimilarity is **0** (they saw
the same sequence) and the execution dissimilarity is **1** (they execute the
reverse). That is the instruction x execution dissociation, and it lives
entirely inside the within-half block.

**Empirical check** (sub-02, TR4, 3161 searchlights, mean single-subject t):

| combo | scope | instr | exec |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| rewDSR_vs_instr | full_no_diag | +0.268 | -0.254 |
| rewDSR_vs_instr | **within_only** | -0.472 | **+0.058** |
| splitDSR_vs_instr | full_no_diag | +0.120 | -0.063 |
| splitDSR_vs_instr | **within_only** | **-0.081** | **+0.011** |

The mirror-image offset is gone. The residual -0.47 for `rewDSR_instr` in the
2-regressor combo is not obviously an artefact: a negative instruction beta on
within-half cells means same-instruction pairs are LESS similar than the
instruction model predicts, which is what you expect if the same-letter pair
(same instruction, reversed execution) is dominated by execution coding.

**No temporal-proximity confound.** Within a half, same-task pairs are closer
in time in TH1 (mean gap 362 vs 594 s) but FURTHER apart in TH2 (575 vs 528 s)
for sub-02 -- the ordering is not systematic, and the gaps are hundreds of
seconds, far outside BOLD autocorrelation.

**No recomputation needed.** `within_only` reads the same `data_RDM_full.npy`
cache as `full_no_diag` and keeps 90 of its 190 columns. Cell ordering is
`np.tril_indices(n_all, k=-1)` in both `get_full_instruction_RDM_per_searchlight`
and `_lower_tri_flat`, verified, so the mask aligns. If those caches survive on
the cluster this is a re-fit, not a re-run.

**Implemented** in `scripts/fMRI_run_RSA_instruction.py`: `within_half_mask()`,
`data_rdm_scope = "within_only"` accepted, model regressors and the cached data
RDM both subset by the same mask, and the `block` nuisance now asserts against
`within_only` (constant there, and unnecessary). Config
`condition_files/rsa_instruction_within_and_across_th.json` renamed to
`rsa_instruction_within_th_only.json`, `name_of_RSA =
within_th_only_intr-vs-exe`, scope `within_only`, block nuisance dropped.

Verified: all 10 single models and all 3 combos are full rank on 90 cells
(2/2, 3/3, 5/5, 9/9).

**The figures and printouts were WRONG for the new scope and are now fixed.**
Three places still described the across block regardless of `data_rdm_scope`:

1. The model-RDM figures always plotted `model_RDM_dir[model]`, the (n, n)
   across block, and the assembled (2n, 2n) figure only fired for
   `full_no_diag`. In `within_only` that meant the saved figure showed cells
   that are not fitted -- and for every instruction model it is a uniform block
   of 1.0, carrying no information at all. Replaced with `_display_RDM()`,
   which returns the matrix for the current scope with excluded cells set to
   NaN (`plot_instruction_RDM` already renders NaN white via
   `masked_invalid` + `set_bad`). Filenames now carry the scope:
   `{results_dir}_{model}_{data_rdm_scope}`.
2. The example data-RDM figure had the same problem; same fix.
3. The printed "execution vs instruction Pearson r" fell through to the
   across-block branch for any scope other than `full_no_diag`, so in
   `within_only` it would have reported a correlation against a constant
   vector. It now always uses `_model_regressor()`, i.e. exactly the vectors
   the OLS sees. `_model_regressor` was moved above the verification block so
   both share one definition.

Also `verify_instruction_rdm_blocks` now runs on the matrix actually fitted
(across block for `across_only`, the assembled matrix otherwise) and prints
which scope it checked.

Rendered all three scopes for `rewDSR_instr` and `rewDSR` to confirm: 100 / 400
/ 200 cells shown for across_only / full_no_diag / within_only, and
`rewDSR_instr` under `across_only` is `unique = [1.]` -- the degenerate uniform
block, now impossible to mistake for a real model RDM.

**Config as it will run:** `within_th_only_intr-vs-exe`, scope `within_only`,
TR set per run, 10 single models + 3 combos (`rewDSR_vs_instr` 2,
`instr_split` 4, `splitDSR_vs_instr` 8) = 24 beta/t/p map sets per subject per
TR. No block nuisance (nothing left to absorb).

**Status of the three scopes.**
- `across_only` -- correct for EXECUTION. Instruction is constant, so it cannot
  be tested there at all.
- `within_only` -- correct for INSTRUCTION, and it also carries the
  instruction x execution dissociation. Execution is estimable but from
  within-run cells only.
- `full_no_diag` -- mixes the two and introduces the block offset. Superseded;
  use it only with the block nuisance, and only as a control.

## 2026-08-28 (evening) — the full_no_diag t-bias diagnosed, and a block nuisance regressor

**The bias is real and it is not regressor collinearity.** Whole-brain t over
all voxels x 12 TRs, `instr_test_full`:

| map | mean t | % voxels > 0 |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| rewDSR_instr (single model) | **+2.07** | 97.0% |
| REWDSR_INSTR-rewDSR_vs_instr | +2.06 | 97.0% |
| rewDSR (single model) | **-1.04** | 15.7% |
| REWDSR-rewDSR_vs_instr | -1.03 | 16.0% |
| simple | -1.18 | 13.7% |

Single-model fits show the same offset, so it is not suppression between
regressors -- and r(rewDSR, rewDSR_instr) = -0.004 anyway. For comparison, the
`across_only` maps sit at -0.48 to +0.71.

**Cause: a within/across block offset in the DATA that the instruction models
encode.** Of the 190 lower-triangle cells, 90 are within-half and 100 across.

- Data (sub-02 TR4, 126 404 searchlights): mean cosine dissimilarity **0.828
  within vs 0.863 across**, a 4.0% offset, with within < across in **88.9%** of
  searchlights. Run-level noise.
- Regressors, correlation with an across-half indicator: every `_instr` model
  **+0.42 to +0.54** (within mean 0.711, across constant 1.000); every
  execution model **-0.13 to -0.17** (0.911 vs 0.820).

An instruction regressor therefore says exactly what the run noise says, and
collects a large positive beta in nearly every voxel; execution collects the
mirror-image negative one.

**The existing group maps CANNOT be corrected post hoc.** 82% of the block
indicator is a direction orthogonal to the old design `[1, instr, exec]`, i.e.
information the fit never computed. Predicting the correctly-fitted beta from
everything that was saved (beta and t for both regressors, 3152 searchlights):
R^2 = **0.577** for instruction, 0.936 for execution. Not a correction, and not
close enough to be one.

**But a re-fit may not need the expensive step.** The searchlight data RDMs are
cached as `data_RDM_full.npy` and `fMRI_run_RSA_instruction.py` already skips
computation when the cache exists. 99.8% of searchlights have no NaN cell (only
3 distinct NaN patterns among the other 293), and the OLS for all 126 111 clean
searchlights at one design takes **21 s** in the current per-searchlight loop
(0.6 s vectorised via `evaluate_model_vec`, 34x). So if those caches survive on
the cluster this is minutes per subject-TR, not days. Worth checking before
committing to a long re-run.

**Implemented:** `build_block_nuisance_RDM()` in
`scripts/fMRI_run_RSA_instruction.py`, reserved regressor name `block`, and a
config flag `add_block_nuisance: true` that appends it to every combo so it
cannot be forgotten in one. Asserts `full_no_diag` scope (in `across_only` it
would be constant). Enabled in
`condition_files/rsa_instruction_within_and_across_th.json`.

Verified on sub-02 TR4: all three combos stay full rank with it
(4/4, 6/6, 10/10), and over 3161 searchlights the mean single-subject t for
`splitDSR_vs_instr` moves from instr +0.120 / exec -0.063 to
**instr -0.101 / exec +0.003 / block +1.319** -- the nuisance takes the offset
and execution recentres on zero.

**What it fixes and what it does not.** After the nuisance absorbs the offset,
where each regressor's remaining variance lives:

| regressor | % within-half | % across-half |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| rewDSR_instr | **100.0%** | 0.0% |
| curr_rew_instr / two_next_rew_instr | **100.0%** | 0.0% |
| rewDSR | 21.4% | 78.6% |
| curr_rew / two_next_rew | 33.1% | 66.9% |

Execution keeps 67-79% of its variance in across-half cells, so the nuisance
makes those fits interpretable. Instruction keeps **zero** -- across halves the
same task is instructed in the reverse order, so those cells carry no
instruction information at all and the estimate is always a purely within-run
comparison, where "same instruction" is also "same stimulus, same run". No
nuisance regressor can change that; it is a property of the counterbalancing.

**Recommendation:** the re-run buys trustworthy execution numbers in
`full_no_diag` (which `across_only` already provides more cleanly) and a clean
demonstration that the instruction effect was the block artefact -- a good
supplementary control. It does NOT make the instruction models usable as
evidence for instruction coding.

## 2026-08-28 (later) — all three per-TR datasets on identical footing

All three now run through `scripts/per_TR_loso.py` / `mc.analyse.loso`, same 5
masks, same seeds, 10 000 SVC perms, LOSO k=50/100/200, whole-brain at 1000.

| # | dataset | maps | scope | output |
|---|---------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `instr_test_full` | 27 (25 usable) | `full_no_diag` | `per_TR_svc_instr_test_full_allTR_2026-08-28` |
| 2 | `split_rew_DSR_per_TR` | 8 | `across_only` | `per_TR_svc_split_rew_DSR_allTR_2026-08-27` |
| 3 | `instruction_per_TR` | 1 (rewDSR) | `across_only` | `per_TR_svc_instruction_rewDSR_allTR_2026-08-28` |

**The reported number reproduces exactly** through the new runner:

    reported   : t=5.079 TR4 MNI -6/32/18 p_FWE=.0407 n_vox=4181
    new runner : t=5.079 TR4 MNI -6/32/18 p_FWE=.0407 n_vox=4179

(The 2-voxel difference is the mask-intersection change; it does not move the p
at four decimals.) Its LOSO is p_FWE = .0144 at TR4. Nothing in MTL or visual
(best p = .47), nothing whole-brain (p = .451).

**Dataset 1 result: every single significant map is an instruction model, and
NO execution map is significant in ANY mask.**

| mask | sig maps | best instruction | best execution |
|------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| mPFC | 6/25 | curr_rew_instr t=6.94 TR2 -6/66/18 **p=.0002** | NEXT_REW-splitDSR_noInstr t=3.77 p=.313 |
| MTL_L | 8/25 | rewDSR_instr t=8.30 TR5 -32/-2/-34 **p<.0001** | THREE_NEXT_REW-splitDSR_noInstr t=3.20 p=.482 |
| MTL_R | 7/25 | curr_rew_instr t=6.41 TR0 22/0/-24 **p=.0002** | t=2.76 p=.665 |
| visual | 6/25 | CURR_REW_INSTR-splitDSR_vs_instr t=8.52 TR3 **p<.0001** | t=4.72 p=.136 |

0 of 10 execution maps reach p<.05 in any of the five masks. Whole brain: 7 of
25 significant, all instruction, peaking t=10.3 at TR2 (rewDSR_instr, 0/-32/-10).

**The scope, not the model, decides the answer.** The same subjects and the
same rewDSR construct give t=5.08, p=.041 in mPFC under `across_only`
(dataset 3) and nothing at all under `full_no_diag` (dataset 1, best mPFC
execution p=.313), while the instruction models go from structurally
impossible (constant regressor) to t=6.9-10.3. Adding the within-half cells
does not add power to the execution test -- it destroys it and replaces it
with a large instruction effect. That is what the within-half confound
predicts: within a half, "same instruction" IS the same visual stimulus in the
same run, so those cells inject stimulus-repetition structure that the
instruction regressor fits and the execution regressor does not.

**Timing supports the stimulus reading.** Peak TRs of the significant
instruction maps cluster early -- TR0:3, TR1:4, TR2:11, TR3:5, TR4:2, TR5:4,
TR6:6 (mode TR2) -- and the LOSO timecourses
(`per_TR_timecourses_instr.pdf`) rise at TR1-3 and decay, the shape of a
response to a screen that is on from 0 s, not of a plan assembled once all
four rewards are known at 6 s. Compare dataset 2, whose across-half execution
channels peak LATE (mPFC two_next TR4-6, left MTL next_rew TR7-8).

**Conclusion for the manuscript:** `across_only` is the defensible scope for
these questions. `full_no_diag` should not be used to compare instruction
against execution, because it is exactly the scope in which the two are
confounded. The instruction models in dataset 1 should not be reported as
evidence for instruction coding.

**Robustness fixes made while running this:**
- `_load_with_retry` -- the first 12-TR `instr_test_full` attempt died at model
  14/27 when `nib.load` transiently failed on an intact TR7 file (sync-backed
  storage). Reads now retry 4x with a 10 s wait; genuinely corrupt files still
  raise.
- `--resume` -- skips models whose outputs exist and rebuilds both summary
  tables from every per-model json on disk, so an interrupted run resumes
  without redoing finished work and still writes complete tables. Verified:
  "resume: 13 of 27 models already complete, 14 to run" -> "summary table
  covers 27 of 27 models".
- `load_ref` now intersects the group masks over the TRs that HAVE one and
  prints how many it used. The `instruction_per_TR` folders only ship
  `mask_all_32_subjects` for TR0 and TR3 -- which is why the original script
  read TR0's and stopped -- and this would otherwise have been a hard failure.
- `base_channel` strips a trailing `_instr`, so a reward channel keeps one
  colour across its execution and instruction variants.

## 2026-08-28 — per-TR LOSO analysis refactored into one runner + one library

The scripts folder had grown four files for one analysis. Consolidated:

**`mc/analyse/loso.py`** (new, registered in `mc/analyse/__init__.py`) holds
everything: inputs (`resolve_nii`, `load_ref`, `load_mask`, `load_masks`,
`discover_models`, `read_model_columns`), statistics (`tstat`, `null_max_t`,
`adaptive_pblock`, `voxel_fwe_p`, `perm_wholebrain`), tests (`run_svc`,
`run_loso`, `run_wholebrain`), volume writing (`vol_from_cols`,
`write_mask_maps`, `write_wholebrain_maps`), results loading (`load_loso`,
`load_settings`, `result_masks`) and plotting (`plot_per_TR_timecourses` plus
the CLAUDE.md palettes and the reward schedule).

**`scripts/per_TR_loso.py`** (new) is the only runner, with three modes:
`--mode run` (analyse, no figures), `--mode plot` (load an existing
`--out-dir` and plot, no recomputation), `--mode both` (default).
In plot mode it reads `settings.json` and defaults to the four reward channels
when present, else every model.

**Archived** to `scripts/old/per_TR_loso_pre_refactor/` with a README:
`svc_loso_test.py`, `svc_loso_batch.py`, `plot_per_TR_timecourses.py`,
`hemisphere_contrast.py` (the last retired at the user's request).

**Equivalence verified before archiving** — both implementations run on the
same input:

    tstat       bit-identical: True
    null_max_t  bit-identical (pblock = 250 and 1000): True
    run_loso    bit-identical to the inline LOSO of svc_loso_test.main(): True

One deliberate behavioural difference remains, as before: `load_ref` intersects
the group mask across all included TRs rather than taking TR0's alone (~21
voxels; mPFC 4181 -> 4182), so the reported `BA32-9-10` p will not reproduce
bit-for-bit. Documented in the archive README.

**References repointed:** `scripts/future_step_dominance_mPFC_lOFC.py` imported
`tstat, null_max_t` from `svc_loso_test` and now imports them from
`mc.analyse.loso`. Prose references updated in
`scripts/fMRI_run_RSA_instruction.py`, `scripts/mask_stats.py`,
`docs/rerun_after_roi_update.md` and
`scripts/old/instruction_phase_alternatives/README.md`.

**Still duplicating this code:** `scripts/mask_stats.py` and
`scripts/mask_stats_spyder.py` carry their own copies of `load_ref`,
`load_mask`, `extract_betas`, `tstat` and `null_max_t` (they compare voxel-wise
FDR against permutation FWE). They pre-date this work and were left alone; they
are the obvious next thing to fold into `mc.analyse.loso`.

## 2026-08-27 (evening, later) — HC/EC hemisphere split: next_rew is left-lateralised

**Masks:** `Garvert_MTL_2mm.nii.gz` split at MNI x = 0 into
`data/masks/Garvert_MTL_2mm_L.nii.gz` (1352 vox, 1332 in-brain) and
`..._R.nii.gz` (1364 vox, 1354 in-brain), provenance in
`Garvert_MTL_2mm_hemispheres.json`. No voxel sits at x = 0, and the two are
near-symmetric in size, so their FWE thresholds are comparable
(t_crit = 4.70 vs 4.67).

**Re-ran** `per_TR_svc_split_rew_DSR_allTR_2026-08-27` with 5 masks
(mPFC, MTL, MTL_L, MTL_R, visual). Same seeds/data, so mPFC / MTL / visual and
the whole-brain maps are unchanged; the folder now also holds the hemispheres.

**SVC, next_rew:**

| mask | peak t | TR | MNI | p_FWE | LOSO peak | LOSO p |
|------|--------|----|-----|-------|-----------|--------|
| MTL bilateral | 5.64 | 7 | -12/-38/-10 | .0116 | TR7 t=2.40 | .0510 |
| **MTL left** | 5.64 | 7 | -12/-38/-10 | **.0054** | TR8 t=3.07 | **.0124** |
| MTL right | 3.68 | 4 | 24/-36/2 | .3224 | TR2 t=0.53 | .6277 |

Splitting HELPS: the same peak voxel goes from p = .0116 bilaterally to
p = .0054 in the left mask, because halving the search volume lowers the
threshold while the effect is entirely on the left. LOSO likewise strengthens
(.051 -> .012, 3 significant seconds TR7/8/9).

**Direct L-R contrast** (`scripts/hemisphere_contrast.py`, new). "Significant
in L, not in R" is not a lateralisation test, so this tests L - R itself on the
per-subject LOSO held-out arrays (each hemisphere selected its own top-k on
n-1 subjects, so the paired difference stays unbiased), with the same
`null_max_t` sign-flip null corrected over the 12 seconds:

| channel | largest \|L-R\| | t(L-R) | p_FWE(L>R) |
|---------|---------------|--------|------------|
| **next_rew** | TR7 | **+2.83** | **.0243** |
| two_next_rew | TR10 | +1.91 | .1479 |
| three_next_rew | TR0 | -1.53 | .2648 (R>L) |
| curr_rew | TR0 | -1.22 | .4399 (R>L) |

So the left-lateralisation of `next_rew` is a real difference, not just a
difference in significance — L > R at TR7 (and TR8, p = .027), FWE-corrected
over seconds. No other channel is lateralised either way.

Left HC/EC t per second for next_rew: 0.14, 0.20, 0.51, 0.79, 0.99, 1.58,
2.36, 2.89, 3.07, 2.64, 1.85, 1.37 — a slow build peaking at TR7-8, i.e. during
the fast second pass, not when B is first shown at 1.5-3 s. Right HC/EC is flat
throughout (max \|t\| = 0.53).

**Figures:** `per_TR_timecourses_MTL_hemispheres.pdf/.jpeg` (+ `_peaks.csv`),
`hemisphere_contrast_MTL_L_vs_MTL_R.csv`.

**Caveat unchanged:** 8 models x 5 masks now, uncorrected across that family.
The lateralisation contrast is 4 tests; next_rew at .024 would not clear
Bonferroni over 4 (.0125). It confirms the direction of an effect selected on
other grounds rather than establishing it independently.

## 2026-08-27 (evening) — split_rew_DSR across all 12 TRs: no reveal staircase

**Data:** `group_RSA_split_rew_DSR_per_TR_glmbase_01-TR{0..11}_cropped` — all 12
TRs present and intact (unlike `instr_test_full`, which is still 11/12
truncated). Its `sub-XX_settings_summary.json` has no `data_rdm_scope` key, so
it ran the default **`across_only`**: every RDM cell is an across-half
comparison, which makes it free of the within-half same-stimulus confound that
limits the `full_no_diag` instruction models. Execution channels only — there
are no `_instr` models in this run.

**Analysis:** `svc_loso_batch.py`, 3 masks, 10 000 SVC perms, LOSO k=50/100/200,
whole-brain maps at 1000 perms. Output
`data/derivatives/group/per_TR_svc_split_rew_DSR_allTR_2026-08-27/`
(+ `per_TR_timecourses.pdf/.jpeg/_peaks.csv` from the new
`scripts/plot_per_TR_timecourses.py`).

**Timing ground truth.** `create_EVs_for_RDMs.py` builds the `01-TR{n}` EV as a
1-s boxcar at `instruct_start + n`, HRF-convolved by FEAT — so the TR axis is
neural seconds with no lag to add back. `show_rewards` in
`mc/latest_experiment/3x3_fMRI_part1.py` shows ONE reward at a time: A 0-1.5,
B 1.5-3, C 3-4.5, D 4.5-6, then a faster refresh A 6-7, B 7-8, C 8-9, D 9-12.

**Result: neither the sequential-reveal staircase nor a synchronous rise at
TR6.** LOSO t per second (k=100), mPFC:

| channel | TR0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| curr (A) | -1.25 | -2.08 | -1.66 | -0.92 | -0.51 | -0.59 | -0.81 | -0.92 | -0.90 | -1.13 | -1.46 | -1.60 |
| next (B) | -0.30 | -0.83 | -0.22 | 0.83 | 1.91 | **2.48** | 2.34 | 2.07 | 1.94 | 1.70 | 1.20 | 0.68 |
| two_next (C) | 0.10 | -0.03 | 0.97 | 2.27 | **3.45\*** | **3.47\*** | **2.82\*** | 2.15 | 1.23 | 0.16 | -0.36 | -0.37 |
| three_next (D) | 0.27 | 0.65 | 1.32 | **1.70** | 1.56 | 1.02 | 0.41 | 0.06 | -0.13 | -0.21 | -0.46 | -0.70 |

- `curr_rew` (reward A) is **never** represented — flat or negative at every
  second, in every mask.
- Peaks run D (TR3) -> C (TR4-6) -> B (TR5-8): if anything the REVERSE of the
  reveal order, and nothing like a double sweep.
- `two_next_rew` is the only channel with FWE-significant LOSO seconds
  (TR4/5/6, p < .05 corrected over the 12 seconds).
- MTL: only `next_rew`, SVC t = 5.64 at **TR7**, MNI -12/-38/-10,
  p_FWE = .012 — five seconds after B is first shown, but coincident with B's
  second appearance (7-8 s).
- Whole brain: only `next_rew` (t = 6.97, TR7, p_FWE = .014) and its combo
  regressor (t = 7.27, TR7, p_FWE = .010). Peak MNI -10/70/-4 is at the very
  anterior edge of the brain mask — check that it is not a smoothing/edge
  artefact before believing it.
- Occipital: nothing (best p_FWE = .144).

**The reported mPFC effect decomposes into the MIDDLE two channels.** The
published instruction-phase result is parent `rewDSR`, t = 5.08 at TR4,
MNI **-6/32/18**, p_FWE = .041. In the split:
`next_rew` t = 4.76 at TR4, MNI **-6/32/18** (p = .081), and `two_next_rew`
t = 4.51 at TR4, MNI **-8/32/18** (p = .113) — the same voxel and the same
second. `curr_rew` (t = 2.64, p = .93) and `three_next_rew` (t = 3.12, p = .74)
contribute nothing. So the mPFC effect is carried by rewards B and C, not by
where the subject is now and not by the last reward. Neither child alone beats
the parent, consistent with them contributing jointly rather than one driving it.

**Multiple comparisons:** 8 models x 3 masks plus 8 whole-brain tests, not
corrected across that family (per the standing request). Bonferroni over 8
models would need p < .00625; `next_rew` whole-brain (.010/.014) and MTL (.012)
do not clear that. Treat the decomposition as the robust part and the
individual p-values as suggestive.

**Still open:** the same split for the INSTRUCTION channels needs the
`instr_test_full` download to finish, and it will carry the within-half
confound, so it is not directly comparable to this run.

## 2026-08-27 (later still) — whole-brain t / FWE-p / uncorrected-p volumes added

**Script:** `scripts/svc_loso_batch.py`, new `--wholebrain` branch.

Motivation: the SVC test only ever reported numbers inside a mask, so there
was nothing to scroll through in fsleyes. `--wholebrain` now writes, per model,
in `wholebrain/`:

| file | what |
|------|------|
| `{model}_t.nii.gz` | observed group t, all brain voxels |
| `{model}_1minusFWEp.nii.gz` | 1-p, FWE over whole brain x all TRs (max-t null) |
| `{model}_1minusp_uncorr.nii.gz` | 1-p, uncorrected, that voxel's own permutation p |
| `{model}_summary.json`, `{model}_null_max_t.npy` | peak stats, the null itself |
| `wholebrain_summary_table.csv` | one row per model |

3-D for a single TR, **4-D (X, Y, Z, TR)** as soon as several TRs are passed —
so the fsleyes TR slider scrubs the instruction period. `--wholebrain-neg`
adds the negative-direction p maps; `--wholebrain-models` restricts which
models get volumes.

**Implementation notes.**
- One read per model still serves everything: with `--wholebrain` the
  extraction target becomes the whole brain mask and each ROI is a column
  subset of it, so adding whole-brain costs no extra I/O.
- `perm_wholebrain()` keeps only the max-t null plus a per-voxel exceedance
  tally, never the (n_perm x n_vox) null, so memory is set by the block size
  and not by n_perm. Blocks are sized to ~1e7 floats.
- The permutation t uses the same sign-flip identity as
  `svc_loso_test.null_max_t` (`var = (S2 - n*M^2)/(n-1)`). To make CLAUDE.md
  rule 4 checkable rather than assumed, the function **asserts** that the
  all-plus-one flip reproduces `tstat(D)` on the observed data — empirical and
  permutation statistic are therefore verifiably the same statistic.
- `n_p_FWE_lt_05` in the whole-brain summary is counted off the p map itself,
  not off the 95th-percentile t threshold; at low n_perm the two drift apart
  (1320 vs 1324 voxels at 200 perms) and only the former matches what you get
  by thresholding the saved map at 0.95.

**Interpretation guard rails, written into the docstrings.** The whole-brain
FWE null corrects over the entire brain mask AND every included TR at once, so
it is far stricter than the small-volume p in the mask folders and the two must
not be compared. The uncorrected map is for looking around, not for claims.
A voxel no permutation beat gets p = 0 / 1-p = 1; that means p < 1/n_perm, not
a real zero.

**Verified** (rewDSR_instr, TR5, 200-perm smoke run): map peak t = 8.8615 at
MNI -34/-2/-34 matches the summary json exactly; 147 358 in-brain voxels
match; uncorrected p <= FWE p at every brain voxel.

**TR5 re-run with the maps** (1000 whole-brain perms, 147 358 voxels; the SVC
mask numbers are unchanged from the earlier entry). 7 of 25 usable maps survive
whole-brain FWE, and every one of them is an `_instr` model:

| model | peak t | MNI | p_FWE | vox p_FWE<.05 |
|-------|--------|-----|-------|---------------|
| rewDSR_instr | 8.86 | -34/-2/-34 | <.001 | 1406 |
| REWDSR_INSTR-rewDSR_vs_instr | 8.86 | -34/-2/-34 | <.001 | 1406 |
| curr_rew_instr | 7.76 | -14/-22/10 | <.001 | 1086 |
| CURR_REW_INSTR-splitDSR_vs_instr | 7.10 | 46/-46/-14 | .001 | 394 |
| two_next_rew_instr | 6.77 | -12/-22/8 | .002 | 109 |
| next_rew_instr | 6.29 | -26/0/4 | .005 | 55 |
| three_next_rew_instr | 6.00 | -12/-22/10 | .008 | 68 |

No execution model comes close (best non-`_instr` whole-brain p = .129). Note
the peaks sit in thalamus / temporal pole / posterior insula rather than in any
of the a-priori regions — consistent with the within-half same-stimulus
confound noted in the entry below, and a further reason not to interpret these
until that control is run.

Output size: 33 MB of volumes for 27 models at one TR; expect ~0.4 GB and
roughly 45-90 min for the full 12-TR sweep.

## 2026-08-27 (later) — instruction models are degenerate in `across_only`, fine in `full_no_diag`

**Diagnosed on sub-02's actual model vectors** (`rewDSR` at the A_reward anchor,
`condition_files/rsa_instruction_full.json` settings).

**Why the across-half instruction RDM is constant.** Within one half, forw and
backw saw the SAME instructed sequence (backw reverses it mentally), so
`instruction_relabel_dict` is correct. But the same task letter is instructed in
the OPPOSITE order in the two halves — task A: half-1 instruction = 1,7,5,3,
half-2 instruction = 3,5,7,1. Reversing four distinct reward positions leaves no
slot matching, so every same-letter across-half cell is a Hamming mismatch (1),
and different-letter cells are 1 as well. The entire TH1 x TH2 block is
therefore uniformly 1.0 — zero variance, for `rewDSR_instr` and all four
`*_rew_instr` split channels alike.

**Consequence — `across_only` is dead for every instruction model.**
`evaluate_model_vec` zeroes a constant column, then `matrix_rank(XtX) < n_aug`
makes it return NaN for EVERY regressor in the design, and
`save_my_RSA_results` writes those NaNs as an all-zero map with no error. Ranks
in `across_only`: `rewDSR_vs_instr` 2/3, `instr_split` 1/5,
`splitDSR_vs_instr` 5/9 — all dead.

**`full_no_diag` is NOT ill-defined.** The within-half blocks W1/W2 carry the
instruction structure ("same letter within this half" = same stimulus = 0), so
the regressors have real variance (std 0.266 for `rewDSR_instr`, 0.344 for the
split channels) and every requested design is full rank: `rewDSR_vs_instr` 3/3,
`instr_split` 5/5, `splitDSR_vs_instr` 9/9, max |r| between regressors 0.644.
Instruction and execution are close to orthogonal there: r = -0.004 (rewDSR),
+0.020 / +0.109 / +0.109 / +0.020 (curr/next/two/three).

**But the identifying variance is entirely within-half.** All 100 across-half
cells sit at the same value, so no across-half pair can inform an instruction
beta — it is estimated only from the 90 within-half cells. Within a half,
"same instruction" is identical to "same task letter", i.e. the same visual
stimulus in the same run. That is precisely the shared-run-noise bias the
`data_rdm_scope` docstring flags and does not correct. The TR5 SVC result
(MTL t = 8.3, visual t = 6.2 for `rewDSR_instr`) is therefore most likely a
within-run same-stimulus effect and must not yet be read as instruction coding
in EC/HC. A within-half-only null (or splitting W1 vs W2) is the control to run.

**Cause of the two all-zero maps found in the earlier TR5 run.** Combo
`rewDSR_noInstr` = [`rewDSR`, `simple`]: `simple` is finite in only 30 of 190
lower-triangle cells, and on exactly those 30 cells `rewDSR` and `simple`
correlate at **r = 1.0** -> rank 2/3 -> NaN for both -> all-zero maps. Not a
bug in the group test. Do not re-run that combo as specified.

**Changes.**
- New `condition_files/rsa_instruction_within_and_across_th.json`
  (`name_of_RSA = within_and_across_th_intr-vs-exe`, `data_rdm_scope =
  full_no_diag`): 10 single models plus combos `rewDSR_vs_instr` [rewDSR,
  rewDSR_instr], `instr_split` [the four `*_rew_instr` channels], and
  `splitDSR_vs_instr` [all 8 exec+instr split channels, as in the old file].
  `simple` dropped.
- `scripts/fMRI_run_RSA_instruction.py`: new `design_rank_report()` plus a
  pre-flight loop that checks every single model and every combo for constant
  regressors / rank deficiency BEFORE any searchlight OLS runs, and raises with
  the offending list instead of silently writing zero maps. Verified: it passes
  all 13 designs of the new config and flags exactly `rewDSR_noInstr` in the old
  one.

## 2026-08-27 — SVC max-t + LOSO over all 27 maps of `instr_test_full`, TR5 only

**Scripts:** `scripts/svc_loso_batch.py` (new), `scripts/svc_loso_test.py` (patched
to resolve `.nii`/`.nii.gz`).
**Output:** `data/derivatives/group/per_TR_svc_instr_test_full_TR5_2026-08-27/`
— `settings.json`, `summary_table.csv`, `run.log`, and per mask/model:
`_svc_summary.json`, `_loso_results.json`, `_loso_k{K}.npy`, plus the volumes
`_t.nii.gz` (observed t), `_voxelFWEp.nii.gz` (voxel-wise FWE p against the
max-t null), `_voxel1minusFWEp.nii.gz` and `_voxel1minusFWEp_neg.nii.gz`
(threshold at 0.95 for p_FWE < .05), and `_null_max_t.npy` (the null itself,
for re-thresholding). 3-D here because one TR was analysed; 4-D (X,Y,Z,TR) when
several are. Neither `svc_loso_test.py` nor the first version of
`svc_loso_batch.py` wrote volumes — added 2026-08-27, verified to reproduce the
json peaks exactly.

**Test.** Identical to the reported instruction-phase test — one-sample t over
32 subjects, sign-flip max-t permutation (10 000 perms, seed 0) corrected over
all voxels in an a-priori mask, plus the LOSO cross-validated readout at
k = 50/100/200. `tstat`, `null_max_t` and the LOSO selection are imported from
`svc_loso_test.py`, so empirical and permutation values come from the same code.

**Masks (3).**
- `mPFC` = `masks/mask_PFC_LR_smoothed_resampled.nii.gz` (BA32/mBA9/mBA10), 4182 vox
- `MTL` = `masks/Garvert_MTL_2mm.nii.gz` (HC/EC), 2695 vox
- `visual` = `masks/visual_occipital_HO25_2mm.nii.gz` (NEW: union of the 8
  occipital Harvard-Oxford cortical labels at thr25 — LOC sup/inf,
  Intracalcarine, Cuneal, Lingual, Occipital Fusiform, Supracalcarine,
  Occipital Pole), 12 497 vox in-brain of 27 220 in the atlas. The 7T FOV
  truncates the occipital pole (3 % covered) and occipital fusiform (1 %), so
  this mask is effectively dorsal/medial occipital + LOC-superior.

**BLOCKER — only TR5 could be analysed.** Of the 12
`group_RSA_instr_test_full_glmbase_01-TR{n}_cropped` folders, only TR5 finished
downloading. All 26 beta maps in each of the other 11 folders fail `gzip -t`,
truncated at exact 256 KB boundaries (6–10 MB of an expected ~28 MB) — an
interrupted transfer, 275 corrupt files. So this run is `--trs 5`: max-t is
corrected over voxels ONLY, not over voxels x TRs, and there is no timecourse.
Re-run across all 12 TRs once the transfer completes.

**Two maps are entirely zero** and were dropped from the tables (25 of 27
remain): `REWDSR-rewDSR_noInstr` and `SIMPLE-rewDSR_noInstr` — i.e. the whole
`rewDSR_noInstr` combo model in `condition_files/rsa_instruction_full.json`
wrote all-zero output. `splitDSR_noInstr` is fine, so it is specific to that
combo. Upstream bug, not a bug in this test.

**Multiple comparisons.** By request, no correction across the family:
each p_FWE is corrected within its own mask only. 25 maps x 3 masks = 75 tests.

**Result — the `_instr` (visual instruction similarity) models dominate
everywhere.** All p_FWE below are within-mask, one-sided positive; LOSO p at
k=100.

| mask | top map | peak t | MNI | p_FWE | LOSO t | LOSO p |
|------|---------|--------|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| mPFC   | curr_rew_instr | 4.79 | -4/38/8 | **.0037** | 3.26 | .0010 |
| mPFC   | CURR_REW_INSTR-splitDSR_vs_instr | 4.70 | -8/42/10 | **.0051** | 3.02 | .0026 |
| mPFC   | rewDSR_instr (= REWDSR_INSTR-rewDSR_vs_instr) | 4.46 | 4/20/34 | **.0107** | 2.26 | .0151 |
| mPFC   | two_next_rew_instr | 4.28 | 4/48/36 | **.0208** | 3.56 | .0007 |
| MTL    | rewDSR_instr | 8.30 | -32/-2/-34 | **<.0001** | 7.18 | <.0001 |

| MTL    | three_next_rew_instr | 5.75 | -24/-8/-24 | **.0006** | 4.04 | .0001 |
| MTL    | next_rew_instr | 5.32 | -22/-10/-28 | **.0023** | 4.53 | <.0001 |
| visual | curr_rew_instr | 6.06 | -10/-90/36 | **.0003** | 3.70 | <.0001 |
| visual | rewDSR_instr | 6.16 | 24/-84/26 | **.0006** | 3.82 | <.0001 |
| visual | two_next_rew_instr | 5.45 | -44/-62/2 | **.0030** | 3.81 | .0002 |

**Not significant anywhere:** every execution-similarity model on its own —
`rewDSR` (mPFC p = .74, MTL .86, visual .49), `simple` (.96 / .99 / .99),
`curr_rew`, `next_rew`, `two_next_rew`, `three_next_rew`, and all four
`*-splitDSR_noInstr` regressors. In the `*_vs_instr` combos the execution
regressor is likewise null while its `_INSTR` partner carries the effect —
i.e. at TR5 the instruction-similarity regressor explains the variance and
leaves nothing for the execution regressor.

**Caveat on the effect sizes.** MTL t = 8.3 and visual t = 6.2 for
`rewDSR_instr` are far above anything the execution models produce, and the
`_instr` models are uniform within (task_i, task_j) 2x2 sub-blocks by
construction. A block-structured regressor of that kind can be picked up by any
residual block structure in the data RDM (e.g. run/session or scanner-drift
structure aligned with task identity), so these should be read as "the
instruction-block model fits" and not yet as evidence about representation.
Worth a control before interpreting.

**Also recorded, descriptive only:** `peak_t_neg` / `p_FWE_neg` — the negative
peak against the same (symmetric) sign-flip null, a second one-sided test not
corrected for testing both directions. 11 of 75 cells have p_neg < .05, the
strongest being `NEXT_REW-splitDSR_noInstr` in MTL (t = -5.02, 32/0/-20,
p = .0035). At an uncorrected .05 with 75 tests, ~3.75 are expected by chance.

**Method note:** the group brain mask here is the intersection of
`mask_all_32_subjects` over all included TRs, not TR0's mask alone as in
`svc_loso_test.load_ref` (the per-TR group masks differ by ~21 voxels; a voxel
entering the max-t search must be valid at every TR the search runs over).

## 2026-08-09 (later) — YER micro positions reconstructed from macro probes

**Script:** `scripts/cell_to_roi_july26.py`

YER's v2026 file ships no `microwires` / `sEEG-micro` rows (202 rows, all
`Type == sEEG`, no `m`-prefixed labels, `NSxSource`/`NSxIndex` empty), so
its 26 cells were the last Baylor cells still on the pre-2026 big-table
macro position.

**The 3.15 mm constant.** Across **all 119 bundles in all 19 files that do
carry `microwires` rows**, the `microwires` position sits exactly
**3.15 mm** from the `sEEG-micro` position (min 3.15, max 3.15), always
*beyond* the probe tip along the insertion axis. Baylor is applying a
nominal Behnke-Fried protrusion, not localising wires individually.

**Validation.** Rebuilding each bundle from its macro probe as
`contact01 − 3.15 mm × unit(contact02 − contact01)` reproduces Baylor's
own supplied `microwires` coordinate to **median 0.25 mm, max 1.07 mm**
over the 113 checkable bundles (YEN excluded; its MNI152 is the corrupt
column). 112/113 within 1 mm. So this is Baylor's own construction, not
an approximation.
*(Sort key must be `Label` — `ElectrodeID` is a mixed int/str column and
sorts lexicographically, which silently picks the wrong contact.)*

YER's own MNI152 column is sound (median 0.00 mm from Fischl(MNI305),
sensible whole-head extent), so the rebuild uses it directly. The
supplied `YER_electrodes.pptx` independently confirms the probe
inventory: 6 probes labelled "microwire" — RT2cHbEb, RT2bHaEa, RF2aCa,
LT2cHbEb, LT2bHaEa, LF2Ca — matching the CSV `ProbeName`s.

Implemented as `reconstruct_micro_from_macro()`, applied only to files
with no micro rows at all, tagged
`baylor_v2026_micro_reconstructed_from_macro` with
`coord_verified = False` (inferred, not supplied).

**Result:** 26 YER cells move by median 3.15 mm (max 10.19 mm). **2 cells
change ROI** (`mLT2bHaEa03`, cells 1 & 2: HC_mid → HC_anterior; that
bundle moves 10.19 mm because the big-table macro coord was on a
different contact). No Baylor cell now uses the big table.

Cumulative vs the aug-09-2026 reference: 112/984 cells moved,
**3/984 changed `alt_final_roi`** (HC_anterior 275→276, HC_mid 232→231;
all other ROIs unchanged).

### How much does the MNI152 provenance actually matter?
Measured on the 78 cell-carrying bundles in the 18 subjects where both a
supplied MNI152 and MNI305 exist: supplied-152 vs Fischl(305→152) differ
by **median 1.79 mm, 95th pct 5.0 mm, max 9.0 mm**, and the ROI verdict
flips for **5/78 bundles = 50/608 cells (8.2 %)**. So coordinates derived
via the plain Fischl affine — YEN (broken 152, 35 cells), YER (26), and
the five affine-only files YEL/YEP/YEQ/YEU/YFT (146) = **207/669 Baylor
cells** — carry roughly a 2 mm positional and ~8 % ROI-label uncertainty
relative to a proper MNI152 normalisation.

## 2026-08-09 — Baylor v2026 electrode tables for YEL / YEN / YFT added to the cell→ROI pipeline

**Script:** `scripts/cell_to_roi_july26.py`
**Output:** `data/ephys_humans/derivatives/neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv`
**Reference (previous run):** `data/ephys_humans/derivatives/old_electrode_tables/aug-09-2026/neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv`
**Per-cell diff:** `data/ephys_humans/derivatives/ROI_assignment/cells_step8_change_vs_previous_run.csv`

### Source data
New `-electrodes_v2026.csv` files placed at the top level of
`data/ephys_humans/ABCD_pts_elecFilesForSvenja_v2026/`: **YEL, YEN, YFT**
(byte-identical re-sends of YEU and YFI arrived as `...[37].csv` /
`...[94].csv` and are ignored by the loader's `-electrodes_v2026.csv`
suffix filter — no content change). **YER** still contains no
`microwires` / `sEEG-micro` rows at all, so its 26 cells remain on
`baylor_bigtable_pre2026_macro_position`.

### Code changes
- `load_baylor_v2026` now reads micro-bundle rows of **either** `Type ==
  "microwires"` **or** `Type == "sEEG-micro"` (new helper
  `_micro_bundle_rows`). `microwires` (the bundle itself, label
  `mLT2bHb01`) wins; `sEEG-micro` (contact 01 of the carrying macro
  probe, label `LT2bHb01`, ~3 mm shallower) only fills bundles with no
  `microwires` row. Both are keyed on the m-prefixed bundle name.
  *In the current data this fallback never fires* — every bundle that
  has an `sEEG-micro` row also has a `microwires` row, so all coordinates
  still come from `microwires`.
- Fixed a pre-existing ordering bug: `alt_final_roi` was consumed by the
  step-7 RSA-ready plot but only assigned at the very bottom of the
  script (`KeyError`). It is now assigned in step 7 where
  `analysis_rois` is computed.
- New **step 8**: change report vs `REFERENCE_TABLE` (an archived copy of
  this script's previous output), printing coordinate shifts per subject,
  cells shifted > 10 mm, `alt_final_roi` counts old vs new, and the
  transition matrix.

### Result
984 cells, unchanged row count. 86 cells moved coordinate; all of them in
YEL (17), YEN (35), YFT (34).

| provenance | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `baylor_v2026_bundle_micro` | 557 | 608 |
| `baylor_v2026_bundle_305to152_unreliable_file` | 0 | 35 |
| `baylor_bigtable_pre2026_macro_position` | 112 | 26 |

YEN's `MNI152_*` columns are internally inconsistent with its `MNI305_*`
columns (mean 55.6 mm, max 71.2 mm disagreement under the Fischl
305→152 transform), so the existing reliability gate correctly rejects
them and uses `MNI305 → 152` instead (`..._305to152_unreliable_file`).

**Coordinate sanity:** 85 / 86 moved cells shifted **3.13–3.15 mm** —
exactly the known macro-last-contact → micro-bundle offset, i.e. a small
local correction, not a relocation. The single exception is
`BY2-YEN`, electrode `mLT2bHb07`, cell idx 2, which moved 60.6 mm:
its big-table coordinate was `(32.3, -19.8, -17.9)` — the **right**-
hemisphere `mRT2bHb` coordinate — despite an `mL...` (left) electrode
label. The label-driven v2026 lookup places it at `(-28.1, -24.2, -14.9)`
together with its seven `mLT2bHb` siblings. This is a big-table
data-entry error being corrected, not a localisation change.

**ROI changes (`alt_final_roi`, the column read by
`mc.analyse.roi_relabel.relabel_per_cell`):** exactly **1 of 984** cells
changed label — the `mLT2bHb07` cell above, `HC_anterior → HC_mid`.

| ROI | before | after | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| HC_anterior | 275 | 274 | −1 |
| HC_mid | 232 | 233 | +1 |
| mOFC | 163 | 163 | 0 |
| mPFC | 155 | 155 | 0 |
| PCC | 61 | 61 | 0 |
| EC | 38 | 38 | 0 |
| (NaN / excluded) | 60 | 60 | 0 |

Downstream RSA results are therefore essentially unaffected; the value of
the update is 86 cells now sitting on verified micro-bundle coordinates
rather than inferred macro-contact positions.

## 2026-08-13 — Cell ↔ fMRI future-lag gradient: extensive exploration (mostly null)

**Question:** do human mPFC single units recapitulate the fMRI DSR "preferred
future angle" gradient — i.e. if we average cells, does anatomical position
predict their preferred spatial-tuning lag the way the fMRI angle map does?

**Scripts (all read `per_cell_ALL_ROIs.csv`, mPFC, 155 cells / 32 subjects):**
`cell_gradient_master_table.py` (master per-cell + group tables),
`gradient_brain_cells_by_lag.py` (MNE medial surfaces, cells coloured by lag),
`cell_gradient_principal_curve.py` (bent-axis sliding window + shift test),
`cell_gradient_split_table.py`, `cell_gradient_split_permgated.py`,
`cell_gradient_full_factorial.py` (320-row robustness grid).
Outputs under `data/ephys_humans/derivatives/group/cell_gradient_master/2026-08-13_09-45-28/`.

**Methods settled on:** pool the 12-lag profiles within a cell group, then read
the preferred lag off the pooled profile (argmax); per-cell argmax and the
continuous first-harmonic angle are both too noisy (harmonic vector length
≈ 0.07; per-cell harmonic angle ~ uniform). fMRI angle sampled at each cell
via symmetrised + 3 mm cos/sin smoothing + 6 mm sphere (quarters map).
Anatomical axis = PC1 of the gradient-mask voxels (folded x) = essentially
dorsoventral (loads [-0.04, -0.41, 0.91], r = 0.98 with MNI z).

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- **Continuous gradient does not exist.** Spearman(future-score, arc-length on a
  bent principal curve) = +0.058, circular-shift p = 0.25, subject-bootstrap
  95% CI [-0.10, +0.19]. In the full factorial, 31/32 correlation configs are
  n.s. (r ≈ 0.0–0.17); ctrl-mode correlations ≈ 0 or negative.
- **Continuous first-harmonic angle** per cell is unusable (near-uniform;
  group bootstrap CIs span the whole circle).
- **Controlled tuning (`_ctrl` columns) shows nothing** reproducible — binned
  pooled lags are chaotic across weighting/gating (confirms prior expectation).
- **Subject-first vs cell averaging** does not stabilise; it only *diverges from*
  cell-weighting where the pooled profile is flat (peak r ≲ 0.05), i.e.
  divergence is a noise flag, not a fixable choice.
- **Perm-gating** (only cells significant at a lag contribute to that lag) does
  not sharpen results; it thins data (median 2–7 cells/lag) and only confirms
  the already-robust groups.
- A real **240° "backward" signal** sits mid-axis (pc1-Q2 / z-middle,
  peak r 0.085–0.10) — genuine, and it blocks any monotone ventral→dorsal ramp.

**The one robust positive:** under **noctrl**, the **future-end bin of the
gradient axis** pools to **60°**, invariant to cell-vs-subject weighting AND to
perm-gating: `all/pc1/half:end`, `all/pc1/quartile:Q3`, and `all/z/quartile:Q4`
all give 60/60/60/60, matching the local fMRI angle (~63°, err 3–9°; pooled
peak r ≈ 0.08–0.16). Interpretation is **local, not a gradient**: "cells in the
deep-future (dorsal/high-z) end of the DSR gradient prefer 60°, matching fMRI
there," NOT "a cell gradient mirrors the fMRI gradient."

**One nominally-significant correlation (EXPLORATORY — treat with caution):**
`noctrl / in_mask / z / perm-gated (≥1 sig lag) / cell-weighted`:
Spearman(future-score, MNI z) = **0.238, shift-p = 0.032, n = 54**. This is
1 hit in 32 tests and does **not survive subject-weighting** (r = 0.028,
p = 0.45), so it is not corrected-significant. Splitting those 54 cells at
median z: low-z (n=27) argmax 240°, future-score +0.00; high-z (n=27) argmax
**60°**, peak r 0.159, future-score +0.087 — the same "high-z → 60°" story.

## 2026-08-26 — SWR pipeline rewrite to Chen/Staresina standard: session audit (Milestone 0)

**Scripts:** `mc/analyse/swr_io.py` (new), `scripts/swr_audit_sessions.py` (new).
Outputs under `data/ephys_humans/derivatives/group/swr/`
(`session_manifest.csv`, `session_blocks.csv`, `session_manifest.json`, `settings.json`).

Motivation: comparison of the existing ripple pipeline against Chen, Staresina et al.
2025 (J Neurosci 45:e1502252025) found seven blocking defects. The most consequential
is that `identify_HPC_ripples.py:122` estimates the detection threshold *within each
cropped snippet*, which partially normalises ripple rate to be constant per snippet and
so suppresses exactly the between-window rate difference the planning hypothesis is
about. Also absent entirely: artifact/IED rejection, a line-noise notch, spectral
validation of candidate events. Full rationale in the plan file.

**Two loaders are currently broken and cannot have run.** `all_trial_times_{XX}.csv`
has **14 columns**, but `scripts/identify_HPC_ripples.py:57` and
`scripts/preprocess_LFP.py:128` assign 13 names, so `df.columns = column_names` raises
`ValueError: Length mismatch` on every session. The correct 14-name contract already
existed at `scripts/behaviour_summary.py:47` and `mc/analyse/helpers_human_cells.py:379`
— the 14th column is `correct`. `swr_io.BEH_COLS` now mirrors it.

**`correct` is per-repeat accuracy, NOT a "plan known" state.** Verified on s05: grids 2
and 9 contain errors *after* the first correct solve. The planning boundary is therefore
derived as a cumulative max within grid (`swr_io.load_behaviour` adds `plan_known`),
which is cleaner than the `found_first_D` heuristic at
`mc/analyse/ripple_helpers.py:69-72`, but the raw column must not be used as a
per-repeat planning state.

**The behavioural clock is continuous across recording blocks; the LFP files are not.**
**25 of 60 sessions are multi-block.** Block *k+1* always continues the block-*k* clock,
separated by a real recording gap: measured range **+7.3 s (s33) to +2910.1 s (s21, a
48-minute break)**; s18 and s27 have three blocks (+229.6 s, +148.8 s). This falsifies
the assumption at `scripts/preprocess_LFP.py:213`, which maps behaviour into block 2 by
subtracting the *file duration* — valid only if recording never stopped. Block offsets
must be estimated per session against three independent references and hard-validated
(every behavioural event inside `[0, duration_k]` with >=5 s margin, else the block
emits no ripples). This is now the highest-risk item in the build; a 20 s error
misassigns every block-2 ripple systematically, which would read as a null rather than
as noise.

**Subject clustering needs a normalised key.** 63 sessions map to 43 distinct
`Subject Label` values but fewer real subjects: s29 is `'UT1-202314'` and s30 is
`'UT202314'` — the same patient in two of the four Utah label formats. 16 labels span
more than one session (`BY2-YEK` = s07/08/09; `BY2-YEX` = s43/44/49). Clustering
robust SEs on the raw label is anticonservative. `swr_io.normalise_subject_key` collapses
them and the audit prints the full map for manual sign-off.

**Audit result (run locally, 60 sessions):** 24 `ok`, 4 `needs_review`, 32
`no_raw_files`. Sites: baylor 36, utah 18, ucla 6. The 32 are simply not on the laptop
— **the audit must be re-run on ceph**, where those sessions' config defects will
surface. The 4 genuine structural defects to resolve by hand: **s03** (UCLA, 2 `.ncs`
recording blocks not represented in the YAML at all), **s18** and **s28** (duplicate
block names in `blocks`), **s32** (yaml=2 blocks, behaviour=1, files=2).

**Config YAML is demoted to a hint.** It disagrees with behaviour and with disk for a
large minority of sessions (`segment: null` for 13; no `blocks` key for s57/58/59;
duplicate block names; block counts that do not match). `session_manifest.csv` is now
the authority for everything downstream.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- Do not use `scipy.signal.resample` on continuous traces — it is FFT-based and wraps
  the end of the recording into the beginning. Silent, and visible only at the two ends.
  Use `resample_poly`. This is also the source of the per-snippet edge ringing in the
  old pipeline.
- Do not downsample to 500 Hz (`preprocess_LFP.py:30-32`). It makes Chen's >250 Hz RMS
  artifact criterion and the 120-200 Hz spectral rejection impossible. Keep 1000 Hz.
- Do not store full stepwise TFR power. The existing `ripple_power_dict_s05` is **5 GB**
  and is not needed by anything.

## 2026-08-26 (later) — Block structure resolved from the raw data, not the config

**Script:** `scripts/swr_diagnose_blocks.py` (new). Reads every neo segment's duration
and channel count out of the raw files and matches them against behavioural block spans.
Written because excluding sessions on a config warning discards data that the recordings
themselves can disambiguate.

**s18 and s28 are fine — the "duplicate block names" warning was a false alarm.** The
duplicates are *filename labels*, not duplicate recordings. Matching by duration is
unambiguous:

| session | behavioural block span | matched recording | slack |
|---|---|---|---|
| s18 | 363.3 s / 4006.1 s / 3432.4 s | EMU-058 seg1 / EMU-059 seg1 / EMU-060 seg0 | +197.0 / +33.9 / +226.4 s |
| s28 | 1819.7 s / 654.6 s / 927.4 s | EMU-045 seg1 / EMU-047 seg1 / EMU-048 seg1 | +41.6 / +58.7 / +36.1 s |

Ordering by **EMU number** (the acquisition counter) is the reliable chronological key;
`blk-NN` labels are not. Note each Baylor file carries a ~2.3 s stub segment plus the
real recording; picking the longest segment per file independently reproduces the YAML
`segment` field for both sessions, so that field is trustworthy where it is populated.

**s32 has a real 444.8 s hole in the middle of a single behavioural block.** Behaviour is
one continuous block (101.8 -> 3883.0 s, 304 repeats). The recording is two files with
**non-zero `t_start` on a common amplifier clock**: 12042.7 s + 1977.5 s, then 14465.0 s
+ 1516.1 s. Recorded wall span 3938.4 s brackets the behavioural span 3781.2 s, but
~445 s of task has no LFP. Usable if the repeats falling in the hole are dropped.

**`t_start` is the amplifier wall clock and gives exact inter-block offsets where it is
populated** (s32: yes; s18/s28: zero). This is the "header wall-clock" offset estimator,
and it is the principled replacement for the file-duration subtraction at
`scripts/preprocess_LFP.py:213`. It is also what the `t_start > 10000` hack at
`preprocess_LFP.py:76-83` was groping at.

**s03 (UCLA) is a SINGLE-block session and is usable.** 164 of its 308 `.ncs` files are
**header-only 16384-byte stubs** with zero data records ("TimeClosed File was not closed
properly") — an aborted first recording. All real data is in the `_0001.ncs` files, which
include both macros (`LMH*`, `RMH*`, `LA*`, `LAC*`, `ROF*`, `RPH*`) and micros (`GA*-`).
Counting the stubs as a second block is what made the YAML look inconsistent.
`swr_io.discover_raw_files` now skips any `.ncs` of exactly the header size.

**UCLA sampling rate in the YAML is wrong.** `config_human_ABCD_iEEG.yaml` declares
`sampling_rate: 1000` for all six UCLA sessions. The s03 `.ncs` headers report
**macros at 2000 Hz** (micros at 32000 Hz). Read the rate from the file header, never
from the config.

**neo cannot read these `.ncs` files.** `NeuralynxRawIO.parse_header()` raises
`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'` at
`neuralynxrawio.py:505` because `global_t_start`/`global_t_stop` are None. A direct
header/record reader (16 KB header, 1044-byte records of
`uint64 ts, uint32 ch, uint32 fs, uint32 n_valid, int16[512]`) works and additionally
exposes the Unix-epoch record timestamps needed for block alignment. UCLA support must
not depend on neo.

**Audit after these fixes: 26 `ok`, 2 `needs_review` (s03 informational, s32 the 445 s
hole), 32 `no_raw_files` (not on the laptop; re-run on ceph).** s18 and s28 moved to `ok`.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- Do not order Baylor blocks by the `blk-NN` label or by the YAML `blocks` list. Both
  contain duplicates. Order by EMU number.
- Do not use `neo.io.NeuralynxIO` / `NeuralynxRawIO` on the UCLA data in this env; it
  raises before returning anything. Parse the `.ncs` header directly.
- Do not trust `sampling_rate` in the YAML for UCLA (says 1000, actually 2000).

## 2026-08-26 (later still) — Anatomy loaders extracted to shared modules (Milestone 1)

**New:** `mc/analyse/anatomy_sources.py` (coordinate sources, all three sites),
`mc/analyse/anatomy_atlas.py` (MaxProbAtlas + the ROI rule ladder).
**Changed:** `scripts/cell_to_roi_july26.py` now imports them; 2514 -> 1880 lines.
**Unchanged:** every output of the cell pipeline.

Rationale: the LFP/ripple pipeline needs to pick hippocampal and mPFC *macro*
contacts by anatomy rather than by string matching (the old
`'H' in channel and 'T' in channel`, and `'1' in label` which also matches
HIP10/11/14). Rather than duplicating the rules, both pipelines now call one
implementation — so "the same anatomical criteria defined HC for cells and for LFP
contacts" is literally true, and a future change to `assign_atlas_roi` propagates to
both instead of silently diverging.

The move was verbatim: `sed`-extracted line ranges 221-617 (loaders) and 982-1029 +
1040-1245 (atlas layer), not retyped. Two structural edits only:
- `discover_utah_mats()` took two module globals of the script; it now takes them as
  keyword arguments defaulted to the same literal paths, so the bare call still works.
- The four atlas objects were built by `nldatasets.fetch_*` at import time; they are
  now built by `get_atlases()`, which populates the same module-level names.
  `assign_atlas_roi` still reads the module globals `juelich` and `HC_ANT_MID_Y`, so
  its body is byte-identical.

**Regression gate — PASSED.** Procedure: (1) confirm the *unmodified* script is
deterministic by re-running it and checking it reproduces its own output
(md5 `e0e758a303831cfc614a2490dcaf6aac`) — it does, so a post-refactor diff cannot be
blamed on pre-existing nondeterminism; (2) refactor; (3) re-run.

`derivatives/neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv` is **byte-identical** after the refactor, as
are all nine `ROI_assignment/cells_step*.csv` intermediates. Baseline copies kept at
`/tmp/swr_refactor_baseline/` for this session.

Note the gate must be against a *fresh run of the current script*, not against
`old_electrode_tables/aug-09-2026/` — that archive legitimately differs
(md5 `9ebfceda...`, 205394 bytes vs 204383) because new electrode files arrived since.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- A static AST check (names used by the script that are defined in the new modules but
  not imported) caught `_bundle_key`, which a syntax check cannot: `py_compile` passes
  on an undefined global. Use the AST check, not `py_compile`, when moving definitions
  out of a flat script.
- The new modules are deliberately NOT added to `mc/analyse/__init__.py`, which imports
  eagerly — adding nilearn/neo-heavy modules there would make every `import mc` in the
  repo pay for them. Import explicitly.

## 2026-08-26 (Milestone 2) — Macro-contact anatomy: hippocampal LFP contacts selected by anatomy, not string matching

**New:** `mc/analyse/contact_anatomy.py`, `scripts/swr_build_contacts.py`.
**Outputs:** `derivatives/s{XX}/LFP/macro_contacts_{XX}.csv` + `bipolar_pairs_{XX}.csv`
per session; `derivatives/group/swr/macro_contacts_all.csv`, `contact_qc.csv`,
`settings.json`.

Replaces contact selection by string matching — the old `'H' in channel and 'T' in
channel` (matches any label containing both letters) and `'1' in label` (also matches
HIP10/11/14) — and the hard-coded contact01−contact04 bipolar pair spanning ~15 mm.

**Result: 160 hippocampal contacts / 164 hippocampal bipolar pairs across 27 sessions**
(baylor 94, utah 60, ucla 6). The remaining 33 sessions have no raw data on the laptop;
re-run on ceph.

### Utah `ElecMapRaw` indexing — a trap that would not have raised
`ElecMapRaw` is an (n, 3) object array `[label, amplifier_channel, other_channel]`.
Coordinates must be read by the **direct row index** into `ElecXYZMNIRaw` /
`ElecAtlasRaw` / `ElecTypeRaw` — **not** by indexing with the channel number.
Verified on s02: row 41 is `bRAHIP2`, and `ElecAtlasRaw[41]` = "Right Hippocampus",
whereas indexing by column 1 gives "Right fusiform gyrus" — a different electrode
entirely, silently. Column 1 is the amplifier channel and matches
`utah_elec_labels_{XX}.csv` for all 114 rows where it is finite (the other 30 are
unlocalised and are dropped with a logged reason).

Also: `m*` = microwire, `b*` = the Behnke-Fried macro on the same shaft, bare = plain
sEEG depth. Macros use `ElecXYZMNIRaw`, not `ElecXYZMNIProj` — gray-matter projection
is right for a spiking micro tip and wrong for a 2 mm macro ring that legitimately
straddles the GM/WM boundary. Both are stored.

### ROI definition: native-space primary, shared atlas ladder as cross-check
Measured on s05/s02/s03, `anatomy_atlas.assign_atlas_roi` has **100% recall but 22%
precision** against the subjects' own segmentations: it calls 49 contacts hippocampal
where the native labels say 11, the excess being amygdala (`RAMG1-4`), lingual gyrus
(`RPHIP1-2`), VentralDC (`RT1cCM04`) and parahippocampal cortex. Expected — that ladder
was tuned for microwire *tips*, where ±2–3 mm neighbourhood rescue is desirable, and is
applied here to MNI152, where MTL registration error is large.

So a macro contact's ROI comes from the **subject's own segmentation**, matching Chen
et al., who identified hippocampal contacts "via visual inspection of postoperative
T1-weighted anatomical MRI scans". The shared ladder is still computed and stored as a
cross-check; because it is a strict superset, only the reverse disagreement is
meaningful. The cell pipeline is unaffected — `assign_atlas_roi` is untouched.

**Use the 3 mm-neighbourhood parcellation, not the single-voxel one.** For Baylor,
`ROI_DK2005_3mm` / `Matter_3mm`, not `Area_fs_vox` / `Matter_fs_vox`. A macro contact is
a ~2 mm ring recording from a volume, so the label must be sampled at that scale. On
YEJ the voxel column calls 1 contact hippocampal and the 3 mm column calls 4 — e.g.
`RT2bHaEa02` is `Right-Hippocampus` at 3 mm and `Right-Cerebral-White-Matter` at the
voxel. Voxel columns retained as `native_region_vox` / `matter_vox`.

**Pair rule:** a bipolar pair is hippocampal if **at least one** of its two contacts is
natively hippocampal — the standard montage (Chen take the most medial hippocampal
contact and its immediate neighbour, frequently white matter). Requiring both would
have given s05 zero pairs.

### Gate — PASSED (5/5)
1. **Probe names plausible.** baylor `RT2bHaEa02`, `LT2HbE02` (Ha/Hb); utah `LAHC1`,
   `bRAHC1`, `LPHC1`; ucla `LMH-1`, `LPH-1`, `RMH-1`.
2. **Atlas concordance 158/160.** The 2 exceptions are `LT2aA01` in s31 and s35 (same
   subject YFF): native says Left-Hippocampus, atlas says EC — an amygdala-probe
   contact 01 sitting on the HC/EC border. Borderline, not a defect.
3. **UCLA independent ground truth: 6/6.** Every UCLA HPC contact carries an ASHS
   hippocampal subfield (DG, CA1, SUB, CA2), and **0 contacts with an ASHS subfield
   were missed**. ASHS is a completely independent segmentation — this is the strongest
   validation available.
4. **Anterior/mid split clean.** HC_anterior y ∈ [−20.8, −3.8]; HC_mid y ∈ [−34.4,
   −21.4]. No overlap at HC_ANT_MID_Y = −21.0.
5. **Bipolar spans sane.** Median 4.68 mm (range 3.08–7.75), i.e. genuine adjacent sEEG
   spacing, versus ~15 mm for the old 01−04 pairing.

**Open point for Milestone 3/4:** adjacent pairs share contacts — pair (2,3) and pair
(3,4) both contain contact 3 — so the 164 pairs are not independent (median 5 per
session, max 11; Chen used ~2 per participant, one per probe). Decide before detection
whether to keep all pairs, or one anchor pair per probe.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- Do not index Utah coordinates via `ElecMapRaw` column 1. It returns another
  electrode's position and raises nothing.
- Do not use `Area_fs_vox` / `Matter_fs_vox` for macro contacts — single-voxel labels
  understate hippocampal coverage ~4x.
- Do not merge anatomy to channels on a key that can be NaN: pandas matches NaN to NaN,
  and s02 fanned 132 channels out to 248 rows before the null-key guard.
- Do not use the atlas ladder alone to select macro contacts (22% precision).

## 2026-08-26 (CORRECTION) — Block alignment is deterministic; the earlier "highest risk" entry was wrong

**This corrects the 2026-08-26 entry above**, which claimed the behavioural clock
includes recording gaps the LFP files do not, and that
`scripts/preprocess_LFP.py:213` (mapping block *k* by subtracting cumulative file
duration) was therefore "badly wrong". **That claim was mistaken. The old approach is
correct.** Verified rather than assumed, via `/tmp/blockfit.py`.

**The behavioural clock is cumulative file duration.** For block *k*,
`offset_k = sum(durations of files 0..k-1)`, and behavioural times map into file *k* as
`t - offset_k`. Tested on all **14 multi-block sessions with local raw data**: every
behavioural event lands inside its file, with head/tail margins of seconds.

s18 worked out exactly: file durations 560.3 / 4040.0 / 3658.8 s give offsets 0 /
560.3 / 4600.3; behavioural block 2 (580.8–4586.9 s) maps to in-file 20.5–4026.6 s
against a 4040.0 s file. The apparent 180.1 s "behavioural gap" I reported earlier is
just the 159.6 s tail of file 1 plus the 20.5 s head of file 2 — **not** a recording gap.

**Wall-clock timestamps are irrelevant, and would have been actively misleading.** The
NSx 2.2/2.3 basic header does carry a `TimeOrigin` SYSTEMTIME at byte offset 294 (neo
reports `rec_datetime = None`, but it parses directly). For s18 those wall clocks are
1943.4 s and 12459.2 s apart, versus file durations of 560.3 and 4040.0 s — i.e. real
elapsed gaps of 20–200 minutes between recordings. Had I anchored blocks to wall clock,
every block-2 ripple would have been misplaced by tens of minutes. The behaviour was
timestamped against the *concatenated* recording, not against wall time.

Two NSx variants exist: `NEURALCD` (2.2/2.3, has TimeOrigin) and `BRSMPGRP` (s32, s33 —
different layout, no TimeOrigin at that offset; neo reports a non-zero `t_start`
instead). Neither is needed for alignment.

**Three sessions overrun by 1–2 s, each by exactly one repeat.** s09 block 2 (−2.0 s),
s10 block 2 (−1.8 s), s33 block 1 (−0.9 s) — 1 repeat of 275, 274 and 296 respectively.
The amplifier was stopped a second or two before the last trial completed. Handle by
dropping the overrunning repeat and logging it; this is not a misalignment (a real one
would be off by tens or hundreds of seconds, not by one trial).

**Consequence for the plan:** block offsets need no three-way estimation and no
wall-clock anchoring. The rule is `cumsum(file durations)`, with a hard validation that
every behavioural event lands inside its file (margin ≥ 0, allowing a single trailing
repeat to be dropped). This removes what I had flagged as the highest-risk item.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- Do not align blocks by NSx `TimeOrigin` / wall clock. It is present and parseable but
  describes real elapsed time between recordings, which the behavioural clock excludes.
  Using it would misplace block 2+ by tens of minutes.
- Do not treat the behavioural inter-block "gap" as a recording gap. It is the tail of
  one file plus the head of the next.

## 2026-08-26 (Milestone 2, CORRECTION) — One bipolar pair per probe, not every adjacent pair

**Corrects the pair counts in the Milestone 2 entry above (164 pairs).** The final
number is **76 pairs across 27 sessions / 18 subjects**.

`build_bipolar_pairs` was generating *every* adjacent pair containing a hippocampal
contact. That over-generated (median 5 per session, max 11) and made the derivations
non-independent: contact 3 appeared in both pair (2,3) and pair (3,4), which the GLM
cannot account for.

Corrected to follow Chen et al. exactly — *"bipolar referencing was performed using the
most medial hippocampal contact and its immediate neighbour (i.e. the second-most
medial contact) **on each hippocampal probe**"* — i.e. **one derivation per probe**, so
no contact is ever reused. Chen report 34 contacts across 17 patients (~2 each); we get
76 across 27 sessions (~2.8 each).

**Anchor = most medial hippocampal contact on the probe, defined geometrically as
min |MNI x|**, not by contact number. Numbering conventions differ between sites
(Baylor contact 01 is deepest; Utah/UCLA differ), so a geometric definition of "medial"
is convention-free.

**Reference rule = immediate neighbour** (`scheme='neighbour'`, the default). Measured
alternatives on the full contact table:

| scheme | pairs | sessions | median span | ref in MTL grey | probes dropped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `neighbour` (Chen) | 76 | 27 | 5.28 mm | 49/76 | 0 |
| `white_matter` | 42 | 23 | 10.15 mm | 0/42 | 34 (no WM contact on probe) |

The white-matter montage gives a cleaner subtraction (no ripple signal in the
reference) but doubles the inter-contact distance, which enlarges the lead field,
degrades spatial specificity, and would *increase* volume-conduction confounds for the
H2 HC–mPFC analysis — the opposite of what that analysis needs. It also drops 34 probes
and 4 sessions. `scheme='white_matter'` remains available for a sensitivity analysis.

The 49/76 references that are themselves MTL grey are expected and are what Chen's own
montage produces (the second-most medial contact on a hippocampal probe is usually
still hippocampus). Ripples are spatially local at the millimetre scale, so adjacent
contacts 5 mm apart do not see identical events and the bipolar preserves them. If
common-mode cancellation turns out to matter, it will show up at the Milestone 4
checkpoint as reduced ripple amplitude or rate.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):**
- Do not generate all adjacent pairs. It inflates n several-fold with non-independent
  derivations sharing contacts.
- Do not pick the anchor by contact number; numbering conventions differ per site.

## 2026-08-27 — Coordinate provenance audit of `cell_to_roi_july26.py`

Full trace of where every one of the 984 cell coordinates in
`neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv` comes from. Written up in
`docs/coordinate_provenance_audit.md`.

**Clean (906 / 984, 92 %):** 608 Baylor from the v2026 `microwires` row as shipped;
140 UCLA big-table coords independently corroborated ≤ 0.5 mm against the v2026
xlsx; 97 Utah reconstructed from the patient's own `Electrodes.mat`; 35 Baylor
MNI305 re-transformed (file failed its own 152-vs-305 gate); 26 Baylor inferred
from the macro probe with Baylor's own 3.15 mm protrusion constant.

**Not clean (78 cells, 7.9 %):** `utah_bigtable_recon_disagrees_gt3mm`. When the
reconstruction from the patient's own `.mat` disagrees with the hand-entered big
table by > 3 mm, the code keeps the **big table** and discards the reconstruction.
Median disagreement **37.9 mm**, max 62.3 mm; 73/78 exceed 10 mm. These currently
contribute mOFC 48, mPFC 18, HC_anterior 9, EC 3.

**Placeholder coordinate found:** 17 cells across UT1-202418 / UT1-202422b /
UT1-202503 all sit at the single point (4.55, 29.50, -20.63), which the atlas
calls mOFC. Those subjects (s54, s53, s55, plus s52 = UT202421) have **no
`Electrodes.mat` anywhere** — the four genuinely missing Utah files. s30 and s42
also lack one but are the same patients as s29 and s41.

**Root cause:** `discover_utah_mats()` coord-matches 3–16 big-table cells against
every folder's electrode pool with no uniqueness constraint, so s47's file was
assigned to six different patients. Measured: **8 of 12 Utah subjects match their
own `s{NN}` folder at 100 %** — the folder numbering is reliable and the
coord-matching was unnecessary. It is also circular: it validates the big table
against files using the big table's own (hand-entered) coordinates as the key.

**NOT changed:** the cell pipeline's behaviour is untouched — fixing items 1–3 in
the audit would change published cell ROIs and is the user's call. Only the
docstring was corrected (it claimed the reconstruction is preferred above 0.5 mm;
the code does the opposite at 3 mm) and an invented rationale was removed from
`discover_utah_mats()`.

**Already fixed in the SWR pipeline:** `mc.analyse.contact_anatomy.resolve_utah_mat`
resolves by folder (own → same patient → exclude with a stated reason), so no
session inherits another patient's electrodes.

### 2026-08-27 (addendum) — is the Utah .mat reconstruction trustworthy?

Validated `build_micro_map` against two independent signals: the microwire label
(`LabelMap`) vs the coordinate (`ElecXYZMNIProj/Raw` via `MicroElec`). Hemisphere
agreement **245/264 = 92.8 %**, region agreement **185/256 = 72.3 %**, against
chance of ~50 % and ~15 %. **The reconstruction method is sound** — but not
uniformly, and three subjects fail individually.

- **s23 (UT1_sj202309) is broken**: hemisphere 8/24, region 0/24. `MicroElec` empty,
  uses the `MicroElecRaw` fallback, labels misaligned to coords (`mLHIP1-8` land at
  x ≈ +8, which is not hippocampus in either hemisphere). Exclude, don't guess.
- **s47 and s39**: hemisphere 24/24 but region 8/24 — needs a look.
- **Resolving by folder fixes UT1_sj202308**: 1/16 → 16/16 hemisphere correct. The
  published laterality was right; the coord-matched file assignment was wrong.
- **MATLAB v7.3 (HDF5) files are silently unreadable**: `_load_mat` returns
  `LabelMap` as bare `None` because string cells are HDF5 object references that are
  never dereferenced. Affects s48, s52, s54, s55 — all four yield ZERO microwires
  and always fall back to the big table. Three of them are the placeholder-coord
  subjects.
- **Files after re-download**: s52, s54, s55 are present but under `Registered/` /
  `Registered-selected/`, which the loader never searches (it only looks in
  `electrodes/`). Only **s53 (UT202422b)** is genuinely absent. s30/s42 lack a file
  but are the same patients as s29/s41.

**UCLA is clean.** `load_ucla_v2026` reads the right sheet (`Sheet1`, the second
sheet, carrying `MNI_x/y/z` + `isMicro`). It does not filter on `isMicro`, but all
**140/140** UCLA cells match a microwire row at ≤ 0.5 mm and none match a macro —
so the missing filter is latent, not an actual error.

Full detail incl. per-subject tables: `docs/coordinate_provenance_audit.md`.
No code paths changed in this session; docstrings only.

### 2026-08-27 (addendum 2) — Utah coordinates: 168/175 now read directly

**Fixed the v7.3 read bug.** `_load_mat` returned `LabelMap` as a bare `None` for
MATLAB v7.3 files because cell-array strings are HDF5 object references that were
never dereferenced. s48, s52, s54, s55 therefore yielded ZERO microwires and always
fell back to the hand-entered big table. Now dereferenced.

**Files declare their own identity.** Every Utah `.mat` carries `Fname` (the original
acquisition path, e.g. `D:\Data\UIC202311\...`). Added `mat_patient_id()` to read it,
which removes the need for coord-matching entirely. Two mismatches found:
`s47` holds patient **202311**'s data (not 202302 — it is the v7 export of the same
165 electrodes as s48), and `s53`'s newly-downloaded file is a **duplicate of s52**
(202421, not 202422b). So UT1-202302 and UT1-202422b have no electrode file.
NOTE these files contain patient *names* in `PatientIDStr` — use the numeric ID.

**Removed the ordering assumption.** `build_micro_map` inferred the label↔coordinate
pairing by sorting microwires by amplifier channel against `MicroElec` (validated on
only s02/s06; failed on s23). Every file also has `MicroElecRaw` + `ElecMapRaw` +
`ElecXYZMNIRaw`, which indexed by the same row give label and coordinate together.
Added `build_micro_label_map()`. Validated across all 15 files: **352/360** microwires
have `sign(MNI_x)` matching the `mL`/`mR` in their own label (the 8 exceptions are
OFC within 2.5 mm of midline). **s23 goes from 8/24 to 24/24.**

**Census across all 984 cells:** 776 read directly from a site file; 140 (UCLA)
verified identical to the site file at ≤0.5 mm; 61 (Baylor) derived by a documented
transform; **7 guessed because no source file exists** (UT1-202302 ×3,
UT1-202422b ×4) = 0.7 %. Utah went from 97/175 to **168/175** readable.

**Not yet wired into `cell_to_roi_july26.py`** — that changes published cell ROIs.

### 2026-08-27 (addendum 3) — full coordinate rebuild from site files only

Re-derived every cell coordinate from the recording site's own electrode file.
Output: `derivatives/ROI_assignment/coordinate_rebuild_2026-08-27/`.

**Baylor and UCLA do not move (0.00 mm)** — the published table already used file
coordinates for both. Every change is Utah: UT1-202503 (52.8 mm), UT1-202418
(42.8), UT1-202421 (42.7), UT1_sj202308 (17.5), UT202314 (2.7), UT202413 (2.7),
UT1-202311 (1.3); all other Utah subjects 0.00.

**UT1_sj202309 (s23) does not move.** Its published coordinate already equalled the
direct read, so the hand-entered table was right for s23 and the old ordering-based
reconstruction was what was wrong — the old code kept the big table there for the
wrong reason.

**26 of 977 cells (2.7 %) change atlas ROI, all Utah:** mOFC→HC_anterior 12,
mOFC→mPFC 6, EC→HC_anterior 3, mPFC→mOFC 3, mOFC→HC_mid 2.

**New alt_final_roi counts (tier C, only the 7 no-file cells excluded):**
EC 38→35, HC_anterior 276→291, HC_mid 231→233, PCC 61→61, **mOFC 163→139**,
mPFC 155→158. 924→917 cells kept.

Only two non-as-shipped sources remain, both flagged: BY2-YEN (35 cells, the file's
own MNI305 through the Fischl affine) and BY2-YER (26 cells, macro + 3.15 mm, where
3.15 mm is Baylor's own constant, identical across all 119 ground-truth bundles and
reproducing them to 0.25 mm median). Dropping YER costs 16 mPFC cells (158→142).

**NULL / dead end (do not re-run):** coord-matching electrode files against the
big table. It is circular — the big table's coordinates are the thing in question —
and with 3-16 cells per subject it has no discriminative power. Use `Fname`.

## 2026-08-27 — Single-unit QC audit

`abcd_passed.mat` verified as `abcd_data_08-Sep-2025.mat` filtered to the QC-passing
units: 63 sessions, 1042 -> 984 (58 removed). Every retained spike train and every
`regionLabel` is byte-identical to the source — neural data and labels both untouched.

**Exclusions:** 36 for < 300 spikes (median 233, range 110-296); 22 as duplicates at
zero-lag r >= 0.50 on 100 ms bins. **All 22 duplicate pairs are within the same
microwire bundle and share a region label** (21/22 by bundle key; the 22nd is adjacent
contacts of one UCLA probe). That is the signature of one neuron on two wires, so the
criterion is doing what it claims — worth stating explicitly in the methods.

Retained population: median 4118 spikes, 10th pct 747, median FR 1.56 Hz, median RPV
0.00%. All three criteria assessed as sound; see `docs/cell_qc_methods.md`.

**Two problems found:**
1. The manuscript states duplicates were removed at *r = 70*. The run actually used
   **r >= 0.50**. At 0.70 only 9 units would have gone rather than 22. Methods text
   needs correcting.
2. **The QC code that produced `abcd_passed.mat` is not in the repo.** Its recorded
   settings include `MinOverallFR_Hz` and `SessionLowFR_Hz`, which appear in none of
   the four QC .m files and in no git commit. Decisions survive in
   `qc_all_sessions.mat`, but the pipeline is not reproducible as it stands.
   Separately, `qc_master_summary.txt` (Aug 2025) passed only 347/924 = 37.6% at
   nominally identical thresholds — almost certainly faulty; mark it superseded.

**New:** `scripts/plot_cell_qc_figure.py` -> `derivatives/group/cell_qc/`
(publication figure + per-cell metrics CSV + settings.json). Reads the stored QC
metrics; recomputes nothing.

Note: 924 in the manuscript is NOT the QC output (984) — it is what survives the
>= 3-subject ROI rule afterwards. The Aug QC run coincidentally had 924 as its
denominator; do not conflate them.

### 2026-08-27 — QC is reproducible again: `scripts/run_cell_qc.m`

Wrote a self-contained MATLAB script that regenerates the accepted-cell set and
`abcd_passed.mat` from `abcd_data_08-Sep-2025.mat`. Verified against the canonical
`qc_all_sessions.mat` (2026-04-16) cell by cell across all 1042 units:

    electrodeLabel differing : 0        RPV      max|diff| 0.00e+00
    n_spikes       differing : 0        corr_max max|diff| 0.00e+00
    accept/reject  differing : 0        fail reason differing : 0

1042 -> 984 (58 excluded), and `abcd_passed_rebuild.mat` matches the canonical file
in size, session count, cell count and electrode-label order.

**Resolved the missing-parameter question.** The canonical run recorded
`MinOverallFR_Hz = 0.1` and `SessionLowFR_Hz = 0.1`, which appear in no script. They
were never applied: 13 accepted units fire below 0.1 Hz (min 0.049 Hz). They are
deliberately NOT implemented in `run_cell_qc.m` — implementing them would change the
accepted set. The three criteria in the script (spike count, RPV, within-bundle
correlation) reproduce the canonical split exactly.

Outputs use an `OUT_SUFFIX` (default `_rebuild`) so nothing canonical is overwritten
until a rebuild has been verified.

### 2026-08-27 — new cell ROI table from site files only

`scripts/build_cell_roi_table.py` ->
`derivatives/ROI_assignment/cells_from_site_files_2026-08-27/neurons_with_ROI_labels_v2.csv`

Every coordinate read from the recording site's own electrode file. Utah files are
resolved by the patient ID each file declares in its own `Fname` (never by
coord-matching), and the Utah coordinate and microwire label are read from the SAME
row index, so no ordering assumption remains.

    baylor_file_micro         608     as shipped
    utah_file_micro           168     as shipped
    ucla_file_micro           140     as shipped
    baylor_file_305to152       35     BY2-YEN, same file's MNI305 + Fischl affine
    baylor_micro_from_macro    26     BY2-YER, macro + 3.15 mm (Baylor's own constant)
    no_electrode_file           7     UT1-202302 (3), UT1-202422b (4)

ROI counts, published -> rebuilt: EC 38->35, HC_anterior 276->291, HC_mid 231->233,
PCC 61->61, **mOFC 163->139**, mPFC 155->158. Cells with an ROI 924 -> 917.

**The 7 cells with no electrode file** take the collaborator's `regionLabel` from
`abcd_data_08-Sep-2025.mat`, flagged `roi_provisional=True`: UT1-202302 -> ROFC,
UT1-202422b -> RHC. Her labels carry hemisphere but not the medial/lateral or
anterior/mid distinction this taxonomy needs, so they are recorded coarsely
(`OFC_unsplit`, `HC_unsplit`) rather than invented. Both fall below the
>=3-subject rule (one subject each) and so carry `alt_final_roi = NaN` — they are
identifiable in the table but do not enter per-ROI analyses. Note this is a real
change for UT1-202422b: those 4 cells were previously counted as **mOFC** because
they sat on the placeholder coordinate; the collaborator calls them hippocampus.

Columns added: `has_coordinate`, `coord_source`, `roi_source`, `roi_provisional`,
`collaborator_regionLabel`, `published_alt_final_roi` (for diffing).

## 2026-08-27 — cell ROI pipeline consolidated onto site electrode files

`scripts/cell_to_roi_july26.py` is again the single script for cell ROIs. Its
coordinate section now reads every coordinate from the recording site's own
electrode file; `scripts/build_cell_roi_table.py` (a temporary standalone) was
deleted rather than left as a second entry point.

**s47 and s53 arrived from the collaborator and close the last gap.** Both declare
the correct patient in their own `Fname`: `s47/Electrodes.mat` -> 202302,
`s53/Electrodes.mat` -> 202422. **All 984 cells now have a coordinate from their own
patient's file — zero unresolved.** (The previously-used `s47/electrodes/` file is a
different patient, 202311; one session folder can hold two patients' files, which is
why folder position is not trusted.)

**The collaborator's labels were right.** With the real files:
  UT1-202302  chan97/102  she said ROFC -> file says mROFC1/mROFC6, atlas mOFC
  UT1-202422b chan116/119 she said RHC  -> file says mRHIP4/mRHIP7 at
                                           (23.5,-16.6,-17.4), atlas HC_anterior
The 4 UT1-202422b cells had been counted as **mOFC** off the placeholder coordinate.
She said hippocampus; she was correct.

**Final coordinate provenance (984 cells):**
    baylor_v2026_bundle_micro                     608
    utah_file_micro                               175
    ucla_file_micro                               140
    baylor_v2026_bundle_305to152_unreliable_file   35
    baylor_v2026_micro_reconstructed_from_macro    26   <- the only inference left

**alt_final_roi:** HC_anterior 275->295, HC_mid 232->233, mPFC 155->158,
**mOFC 163->142**, PCC 61->61, EC 38->35, NaN 60. 33/984 cells changed.

**Also changed, per the rule that anatomy read-in must match across analyses:**
- `load_ucla_v2026` now filters `isMicro`, so a micro cell cannot match a macro row
  (measured: it never did, so this is a guard, not a change).
- `contact_anatomy.resolve_utah_mat` (LFP pipeline) now resolves by declared patient
  ID via the same index. Utah LFP sessions resolved: **18/18**, up from partial.
- New in `anatomy_sources`: `subject_numeric_id`, `index_utah_files_by_id`,
  `index_utah_mats_by_id`, `utah_micro_coord`, `build_micro_label_map`,
  `mat_patient_id`, `mat_text`.

**NULL / dead end (do not re-run):** `discover_utah_mats()` coord-matching. No
uniqueness constraint, assigned s47's file to six patients, and circular — it
validates electrode files against the hand-entered coordinates it is meant to
replace.

**Script inventory after consolidation:**
    scripts/run_cell_qc.m            which units enter    -> abcd_passed.mat
    scripts/cell_to_roi_july26.py    cell anatomy + ROI   -> neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv
    scripts/swr_build_contacts.py    LFP contact anatomy  -> macro_contacts_all.csv

### 2026-08-27 — re-run readiness after the ROI rebuild

Audited all 18 analysis scripts against the rebuilt ROI table. Checklist:
`docs/rerun_after_roi_update.md`.

**Key fact making the re-run cheap:** the analysed cell set is unchanged — same 984
cells, the same 60 excluded by the >=3-subject rule, 0 cells entering or leaving,
33 moving between ROIs. Per-cell statistics therefore do not need recomputing; only
the ROI grouping does, which is what the existing `RELABEL_FROM` hooks do.

**One genuine trap found and fixed.** `RSA_DSR_ROIs_simple.py` had
`RELOAD_RUN = '2026-07-30_15-58-51-fixed_cells-fixed_perms'`, which skips the RSA
and permutation loop and re-renders plots from the old saved CSVs. A re-run would
have silently reproduced the previous result. Set to `None`; old tag kept in a
comment.

**Checked and left alone:** `REUSE_PERMS_FROM_PREVIOUS_RUNS = True` in the same
script is safe — the perm-cache fingerprint includes `cell_ids`, so any ROI whose
membership changed rebuilds its null and PCC (unchanged) legitimately reuses.
`per_lag_encoding.py` (RELOAD + RELABEL), `spatial_peaks_simple.py` and
`encoding_state_sustained_cv.py` (full run + RELABEL) were already correct.

**Four hardcoded upstream run directories** would otherwise mix old and new results.
Marked in source with `# >>> RERUN-CHECK` (`grep -rn "RERUN-CHECK" scripts/`):
`cell_gradient_master_table.py:CELL_TABLE`, `cell_fMRI_angle_match.py:MASTER_DIR`,
`overlay_double_dissociation.py:DEFAULT_PER_CELL_CSV` and `:DEFAULT_PER_LAG_CSV`.

**Unaffected (fMRI / behaviour / rodent only):** behaviour_summary,
create_fMRI_model_RDMs_on_clean_beh, analysis_rodents_complete_clean,
fMRI_run_RSA_without_rsatoolbox_clean, fMRI_mask_vs_cluster_extract,
harmonic_angle_maps, fMRI_run_RSA_instruction, svc_loso_test, plot_cell_qc_figure.

## 2026-08-28 — cell_to_roi_july26.py leaned; glass-brain plotting centralised

Output verified **byte-identical** to the pre-cleanup table (984 cells, mOFC 142,
EC 35, HC_anterior 295). 1790 -> 1633 lines.

**Deleted the text-based intent rescue (98 lines).** `RESCUE_MAX_DIST_MM`,
`INTENT_MAP` and the rescue bookkeeping (`n_rescued`, `rescue_rows`,
`rescue_source_atlas_label`, the unreachable rescue-breakdown report). It had been
disabled since 2026-07-29 and printed "[DISABLED]"; the 4 leftover cells stayed
leftover either way.

**Kept, deliberately:** `_neighborhood_search` and the amygdala/EC boundary pass
inside step 4. That pass is *not* the intent rescue — it is purely
coordinate-based (reassign Amygdala -> EC when Juelich entorhinal is within 3 mm)
and the amygdala pass calls the helper. It currently reassigns 0 cells, but it is
live, principled code, not dead weight. `rescue_dist_mm` is retained because it
records that pass and step 5 reads it.

**Glass-brain plotting moved to `mc/plotting/cell_results.glass_brain_cells()`**
with module constants `GLASS_MARKER_SIZE`, `GLASS_DISPLAY_MODE`, `GLASS_DPI`,
`GLASS_FIGSIZE`, `GLASS_DEFAULT_COLOUR`. Four of the nine figures now call it
(leftover scatter, per-hint leftovers, master ROI plot, per-ROI atlas overlay, and
the reusable `_master_plot`). The remaining figures build bespoke contour legends;
they now take their marker size and colours from the same constants rather than
hardcoding them.

**⚠ Corrected a palette conflict.** `mc/plotting/cell_results._EXTRA_ROI_COLORS`
had `HC_anterior = '#a30d6c'` (magenta) commented as a "CLAUDE.md override".
CLAUDE.md actually assigns **#23677E to HC_anterior** and **#a30d6c to lOFC**, and
`cell_to_roi_july26.py` followed CLAUDE.md. The module is now correct
(HC_anterior teal, lOFC magenta) and completed with PHC and the non-target ROIs,
so the script's local `ROI_COLORS` is derived from it instead of duplicating it.

**This changes figure colours in three other scripts** that call `get_roi_colour`:
`spatial_peaks_simple.py`, `roi_labelling_glassbrain_overview.py` and
`mpfc_coord_shift_glassbrain.py`. Anterior hippocampus will render teal rather
than magenta in those. Revert by swapping the two entries back if the published
figures need to match the old colours.

### 2026-08-28 — ⚠ the gradient analysis is running on stale coordinates

`cell_gradient_master_table.py:279` reads `MNI_x/y/z` from the per-lag
`per_cell_ALL_ROIs.csv`, not from `neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv`. Those coordinates
are frozen at the per-lag **base** run (2026-06-30): `relabel_per_cell` rewrites the
`roi` column only — it never touches coordinates. So the reload+relabel workflow
that is correct for every ROI-grouped analysis is **wrong for the gradient**, which
is about coordinates.

Measured against the canonical table: **140 of 158 mPFC cells carry stale
coordinates.**

    session 52 (Utah)    6 cells   42.1 mm off -- still at the placeholder
                                   (4.55, 29.50, -20.63) vs real (~3, ~19, +20.7);
                                   the z sign flips
    session  6           4 cells   10.4 mm
    sessions 45, 46      5 cells    7.0 mm
    sessions 43,44,49,
             61,62,7,8,9          3.3-4.8 mm  (Baylor - stale from an earlier
                                   coordinate change, not from this rebuild)

Both the old (2026-08-22) and new (2026-08-28) gradient runs use the same stale
source, so the old-vs-new comparison below is internally consistent but **neither
reflects the corrected anatomy**.

Old vs new gradient overlap (both on stale coordinates):

    mPFC cells             155 -> 158
    inside gradient mask    74 ->  72
    ventral / dorsal      42/32 -> 42/30
    PC1 median split     -13.81 -> -13.81 (unchanged)
    ventral pooled lag      30° ->  30°   (unchanged)
    dorsal  pooled lag      60° ->  60°   (unchanged)
    fMRI theta at sites  25-126° -> 25-126°
    recording sites          16 ->  15

**Fix required before trusting any gradient number:** take coordinates in
`cell_gradient_master_table.py` from `neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv` (join on
subject + cell idx, as `relabel_per_cell` does) rather than from the per-cell lag
CSV, which should supply only the lag statistics.

### 2026-08-28 — gradient analysis fixed and re-run on canonical coordinates

**Fix.** `cell_gradient_master_table.py` now refreshes `MNI_x/y/z` from
`neurons_with_ROI_labels.csv` (join on subject + cell idx, the keys
`relabel_per_cell` uses) via a new `refresh_coordinates()`, and raises rather than
proceeding if any cell is unmatched. `CELL_TABLE` supplies the per-cell lag
statistics only. Measured refresh: 158 mPFC cells, median shift 3.32 mm, max
43.1 mm, **143 cells moved > 1 mm**.

**`harmonic_maps_brain_overlay.py` checked and found correct** — it already maps
`MNI_*_final` onto `MNI_*` at load (lines 396-397). No change needed.

**Result (`cell_gradient_master/2026-08-28_15-19-35`):**

    run                      mPFC  in_mask  ventral  dorsal  vent_lag  dors_lag  sites
    paper / pre-rebuild       155       74       42      32       30        60      16
    new ROIs, stale coords    158       72       42      30       30        60      15
    new ROIs, FIXED coords    158       87       48      39       30        60      19

**The ventral-to-dorsal progression is unchanged: ventral 30°, dorsal 60°.** With
correct coordinates it now rests on more cells and more recording sites, not fewer.

Peak strengths shift: ventral r 0.059 -> 0.079, dorsal r 0.125 -> 0.081. The fMRI
gradient angle range sampled by the cells widens at the low end, 25-126° -> 5-120°.

**Paper numbers to update:** "74/155 mPFC units overlap the gradient" -> **87/158**;
"42 neurons at the ventral end and 32 slightly dorsal" -> **48 and 39**;
"n = 16 recording sites" -> **19**. The median split boundary and the 30°/60°
peaks stand.

### 2026-08-28 — inferential test of the ventral/dorsal gradient split

`scripts/gradient_split_stats.py`. Unit of inference is the recording site (87
in-mask cells sit at only **19 distinct coordinates**); the permutation shuffles
the ventral/dorsal label across sites and rebuilds the pooled profiles through the
same code path.

    pooled argmax difference   30 deg (30->60)   p = 0.37
    pooled circular-mean diff  23 deg (29->53)   p = 0.47
    circ-linear corr, angle vs axis position     r = 0.069, p = 0.88
    circ-circ corr, cell pref vs fMRI at site    r = -0.079, p = 0.74

Null argmax shift: median 0 deg, IQR 0-30 deg. A one-bin shift is the smallest
non-zero difference the 12-lag grid allows and occurs by chance in ~1/3 of
permutations. **The ventral/dorsal split is descriptive, not statistically
supported.**

Also: after the coordinate fix the fMRI gradient angle at the cells' own sites is
**58 deg (ventral) vs 61 deg (dorsal)** — a 3 deg difference. The manuscript clause
"consistent with the fMRI progression from 30-75 deg" is not supported at the cell
locations; before the fix these read 71 deg and 100 deg, which is where the
apparent correspondence came from.

Counts to update: 74/155 -> **87/158** in mask; 16 -> **19** recording sites;
42/32 -> **48/39** ventral/dorsal.

Write-up incl. smoothness-index suggestions for Fig 3b:
`docs/gradient_split_stats_and_smoothness.md`.

### 2026-08-28 (addendum) — two corrections on the gradient stats

**1. Tests against zero DO exist and are nominally significant.** I had tested only
the ventral-vs-dorsal contrast. At each group's own peak, one-sided:
ventral 30 deg r=0.079 t(47)=2.44 p=0.009 (cell) / t(11)=0.81 p=0.219 (site);
dorsal 60 deg r=0.081 t(38)=2.21 p=0.017 (cell) / t(6)=2.24 p=0.033 (site).
Caveats: testing at the argmax chosen from the same data is circular (Bonferroni
over 12 lags takes ventral to p=0.11), and it does not test the progression claim.

**2. The fMRI map DOES show a clear progression; my earlier number was wrong.**
Angle by MNI z in the gradient mask runs 59 deg (z -5) -> 95 deg (z +10) ->
158 deg (z +28) -> 333 deg (z +38), monotonic. My "58 vs 61 deg" came from the
pipeline's per-cell lookup, which is a **single voxel** (SPHERE_RADIUS_MM = 0)
averaged arithmetically rather than circularly. I quoted it without checking its
derivation.

The real issue is cell placement: ventral cells span z -4.6 to +4.1 (mean 0.8,
12 sites), dorsal z +1.2 to +9.8 (mean 2.8, 7 sites) -- **2 mm apart with
overlapping ranges**, sampling only the flattest ventral stretch. Recomputed with
the pipeline's constants, all three sampling schemes give dorsal <= ventral:
(a) COM vertex 52/46, (b) per-site vector mean 58/45, (c) mask voxels <=8mm 84/66.
Likely because PC1 = [-0.04, -0.41, 0.91] mixes y and z, and the dorsal group has
higher z but lower y.

**Recommended claim (option d):** the units lie at z -5 to +10 where the map reads
~60-95 deg, overlapping the immediate-future quarter (0-90 deg). Defensible;
the ventral-vs-dorsal progression is not.

### 2026-08-28 (addendum 2) — vs-zero tests stored, and the z-projection works

**New:** `scripts/gradient_split_vs_zero.py` -> `gradient_split_vs_zero.csv`
(cell / site / subject units x 12 lags + the pre-specified 30+60 window, one-sided
vs zero, BH-FDR across the 2 groups and across the 12 lags).
`scripts/gradient_fmri_z_projection.py` -> `fmri_angle_z_profile.csv`,
`fmri_angle_by_group.csv`.

Dorsal cluster is above zero at every unit (q = 0.033-0.067); ventral survives only
at cell level and neither survives the 12-lag correction, so the peak-lag test
should be reported as the pre-specified 30+60 window.

**The z-projection recovers the correspondence.** Vector-mean angle across
gradient-mask voxels per z-slab: 62 deg at z=-2 -> 71 (z=0) -> 82 (z=+2) ->
89 (z=+4) -> 97 (z=+10). Read off at the groups: **ventral z=0.8 -> 70.5 deg,
dorsal z=2.8 -> 81.6 deg** — an 11 deg progression in the predicted direction.

This supersedes the earlier "58 vs 61 deg", which came from the pipeline's
single-voxel lookup averaged arithmetically rather than circularly. Caveats: it is
descriptive, not a test, and the z-ranges overlap. The fMRI range over the cells'
z-span is **~70-97 deg**, not the 30-75 deg the manuscript states.

### 2026-08-28 (addendum 3) — consolidated gradient results table

**New:** `scripts/gradient_results_table.py` ->
`<run>/final_splits/gradient_results_summary.csv`. One tidy long-format table
holding every statistic quoted for Fig 3d, in three blocks:

    contrast  the ventral-vs-dorsal tests (site-level permutation, seed 42).
              These existed nowhere on disk before -- they had only ever run
              interactively -- so they are now reproducible.
    vs_zero   one-sided tests against zero at cell / site / subject level,
              merged from gradient_split_vs_zero.csv
    fmri_z    where each cluster sits on the fMRI gradient z-profile,
              merged from fmri_angle_by_group.csv

`scripts/gradient_split_stats.py` absorbed into it and deleted, so the contrast
tests have a single home.

Permutation values reproduce exactly from seed 42 (argmax p = 0.3722, circular
mean p = 0.4673, circ-linear r = 0.0688 p = 0.8696, circ-circular r = -0.0787
p = 0.7441).

Gradient scripts now, in run order:
    cell_gradient_master_table.py    per-cell master + canonical coordinates
    cell_fMRI_angle_match.py         ventral/dorsal splits
    gradient_split_vs_zero.py        vs-zero tests   -> gradient_split_vs_zero.csv
    gradient_fmri_z_projection.py    fMRI z-profile  -> fmri_angle_*.csv
    gradient_results_table.py        contrasts + merge -> gradient_results_summary.csv

### 2026-08-28 — manuscript gradient-section change list

`docs/manuscript_gradient_section_changes.md`. Every value in the
ventral-to-dorsal gradient section, its Figure 3 legend and the Methods
subsection, checked against the re-run results.

Changes: 74/155 -> **87/158** in mask; 16 -> **19** sites; 42/32 -> **48/39**;
median split -13.81 -> **-13.51 mm**; mPFC 60 deg t(31)=2.245 p=0.016 ->
**t(32)=2.156 p=0.019**; mid HC 0 deg r .055 t(34)=2.27 p=.0147 -> **r .060
t(35)=2.320 p=.0131**; mid HC 330 deg r .038 t(34)=2.072 p=.0229 -> **r .033
t(35)=1.745 p=.0449** (weakens); Fig 3 legend mPFC 155/32 -> **158/33**, HC mid
232/35 -> **233/36**, overlap 74/81 -> **87/71**.

Unchanged: the 30 deg / 60 deg peaks, PC1 = [-0.04, -0.41, 0.91].

Two items **unverified** because `harmonic_angle_maps.py` has not been re-run:
the subject-wise centre-of-mass linear trend (t(32) = 2.78), and the Fig 3b range
"~30 deg ventrally -> ~360/0 deg dorsally" -- my z-profile of the gradient mask
reads ~59-87 deg at the ventral end, so the ventral figure looks too low, but that
is a different computation (surface projection, per-sub-model t>=1.5) and should be
re-derived rather than taken from my number.

The sentence needing most work is the ventral/dorsal one: peaks unchanged, but the
difference is not significant (site-level permutation p = 0.37) and the "consistent
with the fMRI progression from 30-75 deg" clause should be replaced with the
z-projection read-out (ventral 71 deg, dorsal 82 deg). Suggested wording in the doc.

### 2026-08-28 (addendum 4) — gradient stats folded into cell_fMRI_angle_match.py

Deleted `gradient_results_table.py`, `gradient_split_vs_zero.py` and
`gradient_fmri_z_projection.py`. The two read-outs that are kept now live inside
`scripts/cell_fMRI_angle_match.py`, so this part of the analysis is still the
two scripts it always was (`cell_gradient_master_table.py` then
`cell_fMRI_angle_match.py`).

New outputs in `<run>/final_splits/`:

    lagwise_vs_zero.csv        one-sided t vs zero at ALL 12 lags, CELL and
                               SUBJECT level, for all three split schemes
                               (168 rows). BH-FDR across the groups of a scheme
                               within each (unit, lag).
    fmri_z_readout.csv         per group: n cells, n sites, z min/max/mean, the
                               fMRI angle at z mean, and the angle spanned across
                               the group's z range.
    fmri_angle_z_profile.csv   the map's vector-mean angle per 1 mm of MNI z
                               (z -10 to +48), for plotting.

Key values (pc1_ventral_dorsal), unchanged from the standalone scripts:

    cell    ventral 30 deg  r .079  t 2.44  p .0093  q .0185
    cell    dorsal  60 deg  r .081  t 2.21  p .0167  q .0334
    subject ventral 30 deg  r .051  t 1.20  p .1297  q .2595
    subject dorsal  60 deg  r .139  t 2.26  p .0226  q .0452
    ventral  z -4.6 to 4.1 (mean 0.8)  fMRI 70.5 deg at mean, spans 72-89 deg
    dorsal   z  1.2 to 9.8 (mean 2.8)  fMRI 81.6 deg at mean, spans 72-97 deg

The cross-lag rows also show the specificity: ventral is flat at 60 deg
(r = -0.002) and dorsal is weaker at 30 deg (r = 0.049) than at its own 60 deg.

**Dropped, per user decision:** the ventral-vs-dorsal permutation contrast
(argmax p = 0.37, circular mean p = 0.47) and the two continuous correlations.
Note this removes the basis for stating that the ventral/dorsal difference is
not significant -- that caveat now has no stored statistic behind it.

Also fixed while wiring this in: `load_master_provenance` is now called
unconditionally (the z-profile needs the harmonic-root and mask paths, not just
the brain rendering).

### 2026-08-28 (correction) — the fMRI 30 deg region is real; my read-outs were wrong

I twice reported the wrong fMRI angle for the ventral/dorsal cell groups and, on
that basis, wrongly advised that the manuscript's "consistent with the fMRI
progression from 30-75 deg" was unsupported. **It is supported.**

    circular median at the cells' own voxels   ventral  36 deg   dorsal  84 deg   <- correct
    same, eighths map                          ventral  37 deg   dorsal  75 deg
    vector mean at the cells' voxels           ventral  58 deg   dorsal  61 deg   <- misleading
    whole-mask z-profile at group mean z       ventral  70 deg   dorsal  82 deg   <- wrong region

Two compounding errors. (1) I summarised a broadly distributed circular variable
(0-120 deg at the recording sites) with its **vector mean**, which pulls towards
the middle and hid a 36->84 deg separation behind "58 vs 61". (2) Correcting that,
I switched to a **whole-mask z-profile**, which averages the entire y (16-70) and
x (+-14) extent of the gradient mask rather than the neighbourhood the electrodes
occupy -- that region is dominated by 90-120 deg voxels.

`fmri_z_readout.csv` now stores both, named so they cannot be confused:
`fmri_at_cells_median_deg` / `_vec_mean_deg` / `_min_deg` / `_max_deg` (quote
these) and `fmri_zprofile_at_z_*_deg` (context only). Added `_circ_median_deg`
to `cell_fMRI_angle_match.py`.

**Manuscript impact:** item 3 of the change list is withdrawn -- "theta = 30 deg to
75 deg" should stay (measured 36-84 deg); only 74/155 -> 87/158 changes. The
suggested rewording for the ventral/dorsal sentence now quotes 36 deg and 84 deg.

## 2026-08-29 — SWR macro contacts rebuilt on the corrected anatomy

`scripts/swr_build_contacts.py` re-run after the cell-anatomy work. Three fixes,
then 28 -> 32 sessions with a hippocampal bipolar pair (78 -> 98 pairs).

**1. Utah files resolved by declared identity** (from the 2026-08-27 work).
`s47` had been using patient 202311's electrode file and yielded **0** hippocampal
contacts; with its own file (202302) it yields 8 contacts / 3 pairs. `s24` moved
from s23's file to its own (10 -> 8 contacts). Net +1 session.

**2. `index_utah_mats_by_id` now prefers the file that carries the macro arrays.**
It took the first file per patient, which for s04 is a bare top-level
`ChannelMap.mat` with no `ElecMapRaw`/`ElecXYZMNIRaw`. Candidates are now scored on
those keys. Also fixed `merged.setdefault(...)` in `build_macro_table` -- a
DataFrame has no `setdefault`, a latent crash in the no-anatomy branch that only
fired once a mat without macro arrays reached it.

**3. Atlas fallback for `is_hpc` where the site segmentation is silent.**
Six Baylor subjects (YEL, YEP, YEQ, YER, YEU, YFT) ship an electrode file whose
`ROI_DK2005_3mm` column is **0 % populated**, against 91-98 % for every other
subject. Reading only that column concluded "no hippocampal contact" and dropped
**10 sessions** -- a property of the file, not the patient. `_hpc_with_atlas_fallback`
now uses the probabilistic atlas where the site said nothing.

    NULL / dead end: gating that fallback on `native_roi` (the MAPPED ROI) is
    wrong -- it is None for every non-target region, so the atlas overruled 110
    contacts the site had explicitly placed in white matter, fusiform gyrus and
    the inferior lateral ventricle. Gate on `native_region`, the raw
    segmentation string. Caught before it reached any result.

    Final scope: 69 fallback contacts, ALL with `native_region == 'Unknown'`,
    in 3 subjects (YEL, YER, YEU). Recovered s10, s11, s18, s25.
    `hpc_source` ('native' / 'atlas_fallback' / 'none') is written per contact
    so the fallback can be audited or excluded downstream.

**Current state:** 32/60 sessions usable locally (18 baylor, 1 ucla, 9 utah ->
now 22 baylor, 1 ucla, 9 utah), 98 hippocampal bipolar pairs.

**Still excluded:** 26 sessions have **zero raw LFP files on this machine** --
a data-location issue that should resolve on ceph, and the single biggest
remaining gain. s16 (BY2-YEP) reads only 4 channels from its raw header, which
looks like a wrong-nsx or header problem worth a look. s04 (UT1-202216) resolves
its electrode file but 0 of 132 channels join: the table carries `bLACG6`-style
anatomical labels while the raw header carries clinical names (`LCM1`...), so
that join needs a channel-index bridge.

### 2026-08-29 — hippocampal contacts: coordinate-only, one per electrode

Per user decision, macro-contact location is now determined **solely from the MNI
coordinate**. All inference of brain location from site-supplied region strings
was removed.

**Deleted:** `native_roi_label` (the region-string -> ROI mapper) and
`_hpc_with_atlas_fallback` (yesterday's native/atlas hybrid). `native_region` is
still carried in the table as metadata; nothing reads it. The white-matter
reference picker now filters on `atlas_roi` rather than `native_roi`.

**New:** `anatomy_atlas.hippocampal_probability(coords)` -- P(hippocampus) in per
cent from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical PROBABILITY maps. A max-prob atlas gives
a label, which cannot rank two contacts that are both "hippocampus"; picking one
contact per electrode needs a continuous measure, and probability makes
"deepest in the structure" the winner.

    NULL / dead end: `fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('sub-prob-2mm')` returns 22
    labels but only 21 volumes -- 'Background' has no volume, so the 4-D index
    is label_index - 1. Indexing by label position returns 0 % everywhere,
    including at the hippocampal centroid. Caught by the sanity check.

**New:** `contact_anatomy.select_hpc_contacts()` -- per probe, rank contacts by
`hpc_prob` and keep the single highest, provided it clears `HPC_PROB_MIN = 25 %`
(matching the maxprob-thr25 atlases used elsewhere). Adds `hpc_prob`,
`hpc_rank_in_probe` and a strictly one-per-probe `is_hpc`.

**Result:** 108 hippocampal contacts across 108 distinct (session, probe) pairs --
**0 probes with more than one**, invariant verified. 32/60 sessions, 107 bipolar
pairs (baylor 76, ucla 3, utah 28; one Utah probe has no valid reference
partner). Selected contacts: P(hippocampus) median 61 %, IQR 42-84 %, min 26 %.

Of the 128 runner-up contacts on those same probes, 56 would themselves clear
25 % -- i.e. the old rule was admitting roughly twice as many contacts, several
per electrode, which is what the one-per-probe constraint now prevents.

`swr_build_contacts.py`: the atlas is no longer optional. Contact selection is
coordinate-based, so without it no contact can be chosen, and the run yields zero
pairs loudly rather than silently falling back to labels.

### 2026-08-29 — docs and preflight updated for the coordinate-only rule

`data/final_results/ripple_analysis/methods.md`:
- **§4.1 rewritten.** Was "ROI: native-space primary"; now "from the MNI coordinate
  alone". States why the earlier rule was dropped (0 %-populated column for six
  Baylor subjects costing 10 sessions; not comparable across sites; cannot rank
  contacts within a probe) and reports the concordance honestly: of 108 selected
  contacts, 90 have a site label and **71 (79 %)** of those agree. The 19
  disagreements are fusiform (6), amygdala (7), ventricle (5); they carry lower
  confidence (median P(HC) 51 % vs 63 %). Flags the five ventricle contacts as
  worth revisiting once ripple rates exist.
- **§4.2 rewritten.** Anchor is now the highest-P(hippocampus) contact per probe,
  not the most medial. Notes that 56 of 128 runner-ups would clear 25 %, so the
  one-per-probe constraint is doing real work.
- **§4.3** replaced with the current state: 108 contacts, 107 derivations, 32
  sessions, 22 subjects; invariant verified; span median 5.48 mm. Flags that this
  covers only 34 of 60 sessions locally, and that **s61-s63 are absent from the
  config entirely**.
- **§3.5** gains the Utah file-identity rule (`Fname` / `PatientIDStr`), why
  coord-matching was dropped, and that s47 holds two different patients.

`HOW_TO_RUN.md`: cluster prerequisites rewritten. **`nilearn_data` is now
REQUIRED** (the old text said it was not) -- rsync `~/nilearn_data/fsl` (~34 MB)
and set `NILEARN_DATA`, since `sub-prob-2mm` is a new dependency that will not be
in an older cache. Added the rsync for Utah `Electrodes.mat` files, which live in
three different subdirectory names and at the top level for s47/s53.

`scripts/swr_check_inputs.py`: nilearn reclassified from "not required" to
required, and the preflight now actively probes `hippocampal_probability()` at a
canonical hippocampal voxel, failing loudly with the rsync instruction if the
atlas is unreachable.

## 2026-08-29 — first full cluster run, and repo-hygiene fixes

**Cluster result: 50/60 sessions, 173 bipolar derivations** (baylor 131, ucla 11,
utah 34), against 32 sessions / 107 pairs on the development machine. The
one-per-electrode invariant holds at every site (`n_hpc == n_pairs`). Baylor's
131 contacts give 128 `n_hpc_pairs` because 3 anchors are assigned EC by the atlas
ladder despite clearing the P(hippocampus) threshold -- the HC/EC border case.

**⚠ NEVER write into the repository.** `scripts/batch_swr_on_ceph.sh` used
`logs_path="./logs/..."`, relative to the CWD, so SLURM `.out`/`.err`/`.sbatch`
files were written into the git tree -- and an earlier run's had been *committed*.
It now resolves the data root (`$SWR_DATA_ROOT`, then ceph, then the local path)
and writes to `<data_root>/derivatives/group/swr/slurm_logs/`. The tracked `logs/`
directory was removed and `logs/ *.log *.out *.err *.sbatch` added to `.gitignore`.
Swept the rest of the SWR scripts: no other relative output paths.

**Stale `bipolar_pairs` files could send stage 2 down the wrong path.**
`swr_check_inputs.py` counts pair FILES on disk, not sessions that produced pairs
in the latest build, so a file left over from an earlier run reads as "ready for
stage 2". That is the 52-vs-50 discrepancy in the cluster output: 52 files, 50
sessions with pairs, so 2 files are stale. `swr_build_contacts.py` now deletes a
session's pair file when that build produces none, and logs the removal.

**The Utah preflight warning was misleading.** It looked only in
`s{NN}/electrodes/` and reported sessions 30, 42 and 53 as missing an electrode
file. The pipeline resolves by the patient ID each file declares in its own
`Fname`, across several subdirectory names -- s30 and s42 have no file of their own
but share a patient with s29 and s41 and resolve fine. The check now uses
`index_utah_mats_by_id`, the same path the pipeline uses.

**Still to diagnose (9 sessions):** excluded as "no channel matched an electrode
table". Locally this was 2 (s04 Utah, s16 Baylor); on ceph it is 9, so more raw
data has exposed more channel-naming mismatches. Plus s39, which has no `.ns2`
files on ceph at all.

### 2026-09-01 — Utah channel join: two naming conventions, only one supported

The cluster run left 9 sessions at "no channel matched an electrode table", six of
them Utah with exactly 132 channels and **0** resolved (s04, s41, s42, s47, s48,
s53) -- including s47 and s48, which resolve fine on the development machine.

**Cause.** `build_macro_table` keyed the Utah join on `^chan(\d+)$` only. Utah
recordings use two naming conventions and both occur in this dataset:

    s01 / s02 / s23   chanN 128/132 | label 0/132     <- the old key works
    s04               chanN  15/132 | label 89/132    <- every channel dropped

The channel names and the electrode-table labels are the *same vocabulary*
(`LAMG`, `LANT`, `LCM`, `LINS`, `LPHIP`, `bLACG`, `bLAHIP`, `bLMCG` appear in
both), so this is a rename, not different anatomy.

**Fix.** The Utah branch now builds both candidate keys and uses whichever
resolves more channels. Trailing analog channels (`EyeX`, `EyeY`, `Pupil`, `BP`)
fail to match under either key and are reported unresolved -- never matched on
position, which the s02 132-names-vs-128-columns case rules out.

Locally: Utah resolved 809 -> **898**, HC contacts 29 -> 31, sessions **32 -> 33**
(s04 recovered). One-per-probe invariant still holds.

**New:** `scripts/swr_diagnose_channels.py` prints, per session, the channel
source, the first channel names, how many match each candidate key, and the
electrode table's labels -- so a join failure shows the mismatch instead of just
reporting zero. Prints only; writes nothing.

Not addressed yet: s16 (BY2-YEP) reads only 4 channels from its raw header;
s50/s51 (UCLA) are Blackrock but the UCLA join expects `.ncs` filename stems;
s39 has no `.ns2` files on ceph.

### 2026-09-01 — cluster diagnostic: the 9 failures split into four causes

`swr_diagnose_channels.py` on ceph resolved every remaining failure to a cause.

**(a) Clinical channel names, fixed by the dual-key join** — s04, s41, s42, s48.
Their channels are `LCM1` / `RMPFC1` / `RINS1`, not `chanN` (only 14-16 of 132
match). s04 verified: `join by chanN 0/132, join by label 89/132`.

**(b) Electrode file never reached ceph** — s47 and s53 report "electrode table:
NONE for patient 202302 / 202422". Both files exist locally
(`s47/Electrodes.mat`, `s53/Electrodes.mat`, 8 MB each) and are the TOP-LEVEL
Utah files. The rsync include pattern missed them. Nothing to fix in code.

**(c) Degenerate channel cache** — s16's `channels.npy` holds exactly
`['empty-064','empty-128','empty-192','empty-256']`, shadowing a 232-channel
recording. `_load_channels` now ignores a cache whose names are all placeholders
and falls through to the raw header.

**(d) UCLA Blackrock sessions have no bridge** — s50/s51 read `chan129..chan256`
from an `.ns3` header while their xlsx lists `LAI-1` / `LA1`. Unlike Utah, the two
vocabularies do NOT overlap, and the localizations xlsx carries no channel-number
column, so there is nothing to join on. The other UCLA sessions are Neuralynx,
where the `.ncs` filename IS the electrode name. **These two need a channel map
from UCLA; they cannot be recovered from the files we hold.**

Plus s39, which has no `.ns2` files on ceph at all.

Diagnostic now prints both candidate key match counts and says which wins, rather
than only testing `chanN`.

### 2026-09-01 — misfiled-file warning, subject-level coverage, UCLA verdict

**s47 is clean locally, not on ceph.** `s47/Electrodes.mat` declares 202302
(correct for session 47) and `s47/electrodes/Electrodes.mat` is now absent here,
so each folder holds one patient. ceph still carries the misfiled 202311 copy
under `s47/electrodes/`, which is why s48 was served from s47's folder -- both
declare 202311 and the index took whichever sorted first.

`index_utah_mats_by_id` now prints `[MISFILED] patient X declared by BOTH a and b`
when the two locations are in DIFFERENT session folders. Companion files in the
same folder (`Electrodes.mat` + `ChannelMap.mat`) are normal and no longer warn --
the first version flagged all 16 patients, which would have trained the reader to
ignore it.

**UCLA s50/s51 cannot be recovered from the files we hold.** The cell pipeline
never needed a channel bridge: UCLA cells are named `elec2`, `elec36`, and were
matched to the localizations xlsx **by coordinate** (`ucla_file_micro`), inheriting
`source_electrode` such as `RAI_micro-1`. The macro LFP has no coordinates of its
own to match with -- it has channel names (`chan129..chan256`) and needs a mapping
to xlsx electrode names (`LAI-1`, `LA1`). Those vocabularies do not overlap, and
the xlsx carries no channel-number column (checked). The other UCLA sessions are
Neuralynx, where the `.ncs` filename IS the electrode name, which is why they work.
**These two need a channel map from UCLA.**

**Subject-level coverage now reported by `swr_build_contacts.py`**, since several
subjects contribute 2-3 sessions and a session count overstates independent
coverage. Locally: 24 subjects, 24 with LFP, **23 with a usable hippocampal
derivation (96 %)**; the one exception is BY2-YEP, whose only session with data
(s16) has the degenerate channel cache.

s39 has no LFP file at all (confirmed by the user: never received). It is reported
as excluded rather than treated as a failure.

### 2026-09-01 — remaining SWR failures resolved or classified

After the dual-key join and the two rsyncs, the ceph diagnostic shows **6 of 9
recovered**:

    s04  join by label 89/132      s47  join by chanN 91/132  (own file now present)
    s41  join by label 88/132      s48  join by label 90/132  (own file, not s47's)
    s42  join by label 88/132      s53  join by chanN 82/132  (own file now present)

s47 now reads `s47/Electrodes.mat` (202302) and s48 reads
`s48/electrodes/Electrodes.mat` (202311) -- each session on its own patient.

**The remaining three are missing data, not defects:**

- **s16** -- its two `.ns3` files are both the **NSP-2** amplifier and each carries
  4 placeholder channels (`empty-064`...). The raw header gives the same 4 as the
  cache, so this was never a degenerate cache: the NSP-1 files simply are not
  present. Checked every session: **s16 is the only one with NSP-2 and no NSP-1**
  (all others are NSP-1 only), so `files[0]` is not picking the wrong amplifier
  anywhere else. Exclusion reason now says so rather than "channel list unreadable".
- **s39** -- no LFP file was ever received.
- **s50 / s51** -- need a channel map from UCLA (see the previous entry).

**Refactor:** `_load_channels` existed twice, in `swr_build_contacts.py` and
`swr_diagnose_channels.py`, and had already drifted -- the degenerate-cache check
was only in one, so the diagnostic reported s16 differently from the build. Moved
to `contact_anatomy.load_channel_list()`; both call it.

### 2026-09-01 — ripple QC figures

**New:** `scripts/swr_plot_ripples.py` -> `<session>/LFP-ripples/<run>/figures/`
  grand_average_ripple    mean waveform + ripple-locked TFR (the checkpoint)
  examples_best           clearest accepted events
  examples_borderline     accepted events nearest the threshold
  examples_rejected       what the spectral criterion discards

Validated on s02 (239 ripples, 0.168 Hz, Chen ~0.17-0.24): the TFR shows a tight
narrowband peak at ~95 Hz centred on t = 0, inside 80-120 Hz -- a real ripple, not
a broadband artifact.

Two plotting corrections made while building it:
- the mean of the BAND-PASSED signal is near zero however strong the ripples are,
  because ripple phase is not locked across events. Plot the mean ripple
  ENVELOPE; the first version showed a flat red line and looked like a failure.
- events too close to a recording edge were skipped after selection, leaving holes
  in the example grid. Select from cuttable events instead.

**Two things for the user to judge from these figures:**
1. The borderline accepted events (z = 3.0-3.1) show near-continuous 80-120 Hz
   activity with only a modest increase in the detected window. Whether
   `PEAK_SD = 3.0` is too permissive is a judgement call these panels make visible.
2. Several REJECTED events look like clean ripples (e.g. z = 7.6 at 90 Hz).
   Strict spectral rejection is 32.1% here against Chen's 23.4% +- 9.9%; the
   relaxed variant gives 18.2%. Worth deciding which is primary before the full run.

**PSD questions answered:** the notch is adaptive (`notch_ratio_threshold = 2.0`),
so sessions differ by design -- s02 had a 60 Hz line-noise ratio of **16958x**,
notched to a residual of **0.014x**, while a session with no line noise is left
untouched and shows a smooth 1/f. A narrowband peak INSIDE the ripple band (the
~90 Hz spike on one s01 contact) is not addressed by the notch and is a genuine
concern for that contact.

### 2026-09-01 — QC consolidated into swr_qc_report.py, plus a numeric checkpoint

**`swr_plot_ripples.py` deleted, merged into `swr_qc_report.py`.** That script
already produced the 6-panel checkpoint figure, so a second plotting script was
duplication. `swr_qc_report.py report --session=N` now also writes
`figures/examples_{best,borderline,rejected}.pdf`.

**New: a numeric checkpoint.** "Looks fine" does not scale to 56 sessions, so the
methods.md section 6 criteria are now evaluated numerically against Chen's
reference values, with FAIL (outside a hard range -- do not analyse as is) and
CHECK (outside the reference range -- look at it) verdicts:

    rate_hz              hard 0.05-0.60   ref 0.17-0.24
    spectral_reject_pct  hard 5-50        ref 13.5-33.3   (Chen 23.4 +- 9.9)
    peak_freq_hz         hard 80-120      ref 85-115
    duration_ms          hard 38-500      ref 40-120
    clean_frac           hard 0.33-1.0    ref 0.50-1.0
    ripple_gain          hard >1.2        ref >1.5

`ripple_gain` is the mean ripple-band envelope at the peak over its value at the
window edges -- a detector triggering on broadband noise gives ~1, so it turns
"the grand average looks like a ripple" into a number.

    swr_qc_report.py report  --session=N   figure + grids + metrics
    swr_qc_report.py metrics --session=N   metrics only (fast, for the cluster)
    swr_qc_report.py group                 aggregate every session -> triage table

**Bug found by the new metric:** `clean_frac` was medianed over *all* derivations
including ones already excluded for contamination, so s02 reported 0.361 (a CHECK)
when the analysed pair actually keeps 0.586. An excluded pair must not drag down the
session it was excluded from. `qc_metrics` now filters on `excluded` first.

s02 after the fix: rate 0.168 (CHECK, two ripples below Chen's 0.17), rejection
32.1%, peak 100 Hz, duration 56 ms, clean 0.586, ripple gain 2.98. No FAILs.

**PEAK_SD = 3.0 is kept, and the visual worry about it was wrong.** Events at the
threshold look unconvincing on the example grids, but that is a plotting artifact:
the band-passed trace is scaled x9-x34 to share an axis with broadband, which
magnifies the ongoing band activity as much as the burst. Measured per event
(envelope at peak / envelope at +-0.20-0.25 s), the z=3.0-3.5 bin has median gain
2.65 with 1% below 1.5 -- these are real bursts. Raising to 3.5 would drop 94 of 238
events (0.168 -> 0.098 Hz, well below Chen) for +0.26 gain. Recorded in methods.md
section 6.3 with the full table.

**NULL / dead ends (do not re-run):** rate over *total* recording time is 0.098 Hz
and is the wrong number -- Chen's denominator is artifact-free time, giving 0.168.

**Fixed a misleading plot title.** `qc_psd.png` said "Bipolar derivations after
notch" whether or not the notch had fired, so a session with no line noise looked
like a filter failure. It now reads either "notch applied at 60, 120, 180 Hz" or
"no notch needed (line-noise ratio below threshold)".

**Group QC across the 8-session development set — no FAILs, all usable.**

Rate 0.154-0.206 (Chen 0.17-0.24), peak frequency 95-100 Hz, duration 56-61 ms,
ripple gain 2.80-3.12. Those four are tight across sessions, sites and montages,
which is the real evidence that detection is stable.

The one systematic deviation is spectral rejection: 6 of 8 sessions above Chen's
upper bound, mean 34.5% strict vs 21.6% relaxed. Relaxed matches Chen almost
exactly -- and that is NOT a reason to switch, because picking the criterion that
best reproduces another paper's number after seeing which one does is post-hoc.
Strict stays primary as pre-declared; relaxed remains the sensitivity analysis on
19% more events (5006 vs 4194). See methods.md section 6.2.
