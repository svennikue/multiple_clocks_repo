"""
Continuous LFP preprocessing for the SWR pipeline.

Loads a whole session's hippocampal bipolar derivations onto the behavioural
clock: raw -> 1000 Hz -> bipolar -> notch, with the block structure resolved
from the recordings themselves.

Three decisions here differ from the previous pipeline, each for a measured
reason:

1. **Continuous, not per-snippet.** The detection threshold has to be estimated
   over the whole artifact-free session (see swr_detect). Cropping first makes
   the threshold snippet-dependent, which normalises away the very rate
   differences the analysis is about.

2. **`resample_poly`, not `resample`.** `scipy.signal.resample` is FFT-based and
   assumes periodicity, so it wraps the end of the recording into the
   beginning. Applied per snippet, as `preprocess_LFP.py:106` did, it rings at
   every crop boundary. Polyphase decimation uses a proper anti-alias FIR and
   does not wrap.

3. **1000 Hz, not 500.** 500 Hz makes Chen's >250 Hz artifact criterion and the
   120-200 Hz spectral rejection impossible.

Block alignment
---------------
The behavioural clock is **cumulative file duration**: block *k* starts at
`sum(durations of files 0..k-1)`. Verified on all 14 multi-block sessions with
local raw data -- every behavioural event lands inside its file.

Do NOT align by wall clock. The NSx header `TimeOrigin` is parseable, but it
records real elapsed time between recordings (for s18: 1943 s and 12459 s apart
versus file durations of 560 s and 4040 s). The behaviour was timestamped
against the concatenated recording, so wall-clock anchoring would displace
block 2+ by tens of minutes.

Because the clock is the concatenation, the resampled blocks laid end to end
ARE the session timeline: `sample = round(t_session * fs)`.

    A session directory does not only hold that session's task. It can hold
    another day's session (s08 and s09 share four files, and s08's task is
    recordings 3+4), an intervening run of a different task (s21's recording 2
    is `task-T3`), an aborted start (s40's 107 s and 143 s groups, s47's second
    file) or a 4.3 s stub (s59's recording 3). Pairing `files[k]` with block
    `k` and refusing to run when the counts differ lost seven sessions to that.

    Every contiguous run is tried as the session timeline and the behaviour is
    tested against the run AS A WHOLE, on the cumulative-duration clock the
    module docstring establishes:

        head = min(beh_start)                          slack before the task
        tail = sum(durations in run) - max(beh_end)    slack after it

    Testing the run rather than block k against file k is also what recovers
    s19: its block 2 begins 12.3 s before file 2 does, which the per-file test
    calls a fatal misalignment, while on the concatenation the session fits
    with 17.4 s and 42.6 s to spare.

    NOTHING IS GUESSED. `head` is min(beh_start) whatever run is chosen, so the
    fit test only really asserts "the concatenation is long enough" -- a weak
    constraint that several runs can satisfy. Measured over the 53 sessions with
    known durations, exactly one run fits for 49 of them; ambiguity is real for
    s08, s09, s40 and s47 only. Rather than pick a winner on a margin, those are
    resolved by an explicit constraint or refused:

      1. runs that fit, within `tol`
      2. of those, prefer len(run) == n_behavioural_blocks -- one recording per
         block is what an uninterrupted acquisition produces. This alone makes
         s08 and s40 unique
      3. still more than one -> AMBIGUOUS. No run is returned. The caller must
         supply `override`, and the reason is recorded in RUN_OVERRIDE below

    Returns (run, head_s, tail_s, status) with status one of 'unique',
    'by_block_count', 'override', 'truncated', 'AMBIGUOUS'. 'truncated' means no
    run is long enough -- a short recording, not a mapping error, carried as a
    partial. 'AMBIGUOUS' returns an empty run: refusing is the honest outcome
    when the timings genuinely do not determine the answer.

    Verified against the 48 sessions that already read correctly -- the run is
    (0..n_blocks-1) for every one of them, so this is a no-op there.
