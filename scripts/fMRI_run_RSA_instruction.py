Instruction-phase searchlight RSA, run separately for every second of the
instruction period. Per subject, per TR, per model: one whole-brain beta map.
RQ


------------
Is the action plan assembled BEFORE any action is executed? The task was
designed so that each layout is instructed once forwards and once backwards
(1-2-3-4 and 4-3-2-1), and subjects either followed the instructed order or
mentally reversed it, with reversal trials marked from the first reward cue.
That gives a 2x2 of visual instruction x execution, which is what lets a
representation of what was just SEEN be separated from a representation of
what will be DONE. The reward-DSR models describe the similarity of future
executions anchored at 'A' and are deliberately different from the observed
instructed order, so a fit to them cannot be explained by the visual input.

PAIRING AND THE TWO MODEL FAMILIES
----------------------------------
Conditions are paired by same EXECUTION (A1_forw <-> A2_backw), so the RDM
compares two independent task halves that share a plan but not a stimulus.
Any model can then be built in two variants:
  <model>          execution similarity — the plan the subject will carry out
  <model>_instr    instruction similarity — built by `instruction_relabel_dict`,
                   which overwrites each '_backw_' entry with its '_forw_'
                   counterpart so that both directions share the vector they
                   were SHOWN. Under the execution-based pairing this makes
                   every (task_i, task_j) 2x2 sub-block internally uniform,
                   which `verify_instruction_rdm_blocks` checks and prints.
The two variants are also correlated with each other and reported, so the
shared variance between "what was seen" and "what will be done" is explicit.

`rewDSR` at the A_reward anchor is four equal chunks, one per reward step
(A, B, C, D). Two families of models are sliced out of it, both literal
slices so that Hamming behaves identically to Hamming on rewDSR itself
rather than on the 9-dim one-hot stored under those names:
  SPLIT       one chunk each — A_rew, B_rew, C_rew, D_rew.
              "which single future reward is this".
  CUMULATIVE  the first k chunks — A_rew (A), AB_rew (A+B), ABC_rew (A+B+C),
              ABCD_rew (A+B+C+D, i.e. the whole rewDSR vector). "how much of
              the plan is already assembled". Because the chunks are equally
              long, Hamming on a cumulative channel is exactly the mean of the
              per-step Hammings it contains, so the family is strictly nested
              and ABCD_rew IS rewDSR.
Each of those has an `_instr` counterpart built the same way. The pre-rename
names (curr_rew / next_rew / two_next_rew / three_next_rew / two_rew /
three_rew) are rejected with a pointer to the new one — see
`LEGACY_MODEL_NAMES`.

DATA RDM SCOPE (config: `data_rdm_scope`)
    'across_only'  (default) only the TH1 x TH2 off-block, so every cell is
                   an across-half comparison and run-level noise cannot
                   inflate similarity.
    'full_no_diag' the symmetric (2n x 2n) matrix, strict lower triangle.
                   Nearly doubles the pairs the OLS sees, but the within-half
                   cells share run-level noise and are therefore biased
                   toward looking similar; that bias is NOT corrected.
    'within_only'  only the two within-half blocks. Required for anything
                   instruction-based: across halves a task is instructed in
                   the reverse order, so instruction dissim is constant there
                   and carries no variance at all.

Individual models can override this and be fitted in more than one scope:
  combo models    a `"scope"` key on the combo entry (string or list) — this
                  is how `exe_split` is fitted once within and once across
                  task halves in the same run.
  single models   `"single_model_scopes"` in the config, e.g.
                      {"execution": ["within_only", "across_only"],
                       "instruction": ["within_only"]}
                  applied by name: anything ending in `_instr` is
                  'instruction', everything else 'execution'. Execution models
                  carry variance in both blocks and are worth having both ways;
                  instruction models are constant across halves and can only be
                  fitted within.
Outputs that come from such an override are suffixed `_within` / `_across` /
`_full` so the variants never overwrite each other. All scopes are subsets of
the same cached (2n x 2n) data RDM, so running several costs no extra
searchlight work. (The legacy top-level `'across_only'` mode keeps its own
(n x n) cache and cannot be mixed with per-model or per-combo scopes.)

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (this script does NOT do group statistics)
------------------------------------------------------------
Per-subject maps are smoothed (FWHM 5 mm), masked to voxels present in all
subjects and stacked into
    group_RSA_instruction_per_TR_glmbase_01-TR{tr}_cropped/
        cropped_masked_smooth_fwhm5_{model}_beta_std.nii   (X, Y, Z, n_subj)
Group inference for the reported instruction-phase result is then done by
`scripts/per_TR_loso.py` (statistics in `mc.analyse.loso`): a max-t
sign-flip permutation test inside an
a-priori BA32 / medial BA9 / medial BA10 mask, correcting over voxels and
seconds jointly, plus a leave-one-subject-out cross-validated timecourse.

USAGE
    python fMRI_run_RSA_instruction.py <subj_no> [config.json]
    (default config: rsa_instruction_full.json; the TR is set in the config,
     so one run of this script = one second of the instruction phase)

# 'across_only'   : classic behaviour — n_conds x n_conds cross-block only
#                   (TH1 vs TH2). Each cell is a pure across-runs comparison,
#                   so run-level noise cannot inflate similarity.
# 'full_no_diag'  : symmetric (2n_conds x 2n_conds) full RDM (within-run-1,
#                   across, within-run-2), strict lower triangle only (k=-1),
#                   diagonal dropped. Nearly doubles the number of pairs the
#                   OLS sees. Off-diagonal within-run cells share run-level
#                   noise → within-run pairs tend to look more similar than
#                   across-run pairs at the same true stimulus similarity;
#                   this bias is known but not corrected here.
# 'within_only'   : the strict lower triangle of the two WITHIN-half blocks
#                   only. Built from the same (2n x 2n) matrix as
#                   'full_no_diag' and then subset, so it reuses the same
#                   cached data RDM. Use this for instruction-similarity
#                   questions: the across-half block carries no instruction
#                   information (constant by design) and its similarity offset
#                   against the within-half block is what biases every
