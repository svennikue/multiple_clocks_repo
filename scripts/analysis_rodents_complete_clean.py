"""
Rodent DSR RSA — validation of the action-plan (DSR) model on El-Gaby et
al. (2024) mPFC recordings.

Purpose: show that the same RSA machinery used for the human fMRI and
human single units recovers the concurrent-future-location code that
El-Gaby et al. found at the level of individual mouse neurons, and that
it does NOT find an abstract position-in-sequence code — reproducing both
central properties of the original result.

WHAT IS COMPARED
----------------
Per recording day, the geometry of the recorded population across
timepoints × task configurations is compared against the geometry of four
simulated populations. All four enter ONE joint GLM, so the action-plan
model has to explain variance beyond the simpler codes:

    dsr_fmri  'Action Plan'        concurrent future locations (see below)
    stat      'Position in Seq.'   ordinal position A/B/C/D, config-general
    loc       'Physical Location'  place code (9 grid nodes)
    phas      'Subgoal Progress'   within-state phase (von Mises tuning)

`MODEL_ORDER_DSR` is the fitted combo. The rodent-native DSR variant
(`dsr`) and the location×phase model (`midn`) are computed but excluded:
`dsr` and `dsr_fmri` correlate at r ≈ 0.6 and cannibalise each other's β
in a joint fit (see diagnose_dsr_vs_dsr_fmri.py, 2026-07-27_22-28-27).
`dsr_fmri` is the primary regressor because it is built exactly like the
human pipeline (RSA_DSR_ROIs_simple.build_mode_path_dsr).
NEURAL DATA -> RDM
------------------
Normalised recordings, 360 bins per ABCD loop. Per recday:
  1. PHASE-RESIDUALISE each cell (see PHASE_RESIDUALISE below) — this is
     the step that removes the subgoal-progress signal, which is the
     strongest signal in this dataset and would otherwise dominate.
  2. Average across trials within a task configuration.
  3. Downsample 360 -> N_CONDS_PER_CONFIG conditions (mean over bins).
  4. Concatenate configurations, z-score each neuron across all columns.
  5. RDM = 1 − Pearson correlation across neurons, between every pair of
     (configuration, timepoint) columns.

MODEL RDMs
----------
Built from the MODE path across trials of a configuration (the single
most frequent trajectory, not an average — an averaged path is not a
valid trajectory), via `mc.simulation.predictions.model_DSR`.

`dsr_fmri` specifically: the mode path is downsampled to
N_CONDS_PER_CONFIG × 12 integer node IDs (12 × 12 = 144 with the current
settings), and for each of the N_CONDS_PER_CONFIG timepoints that vector
is rolled left by `pos × 12`, so it always reads
[current segment | next | ... | previous]. Every timepoint therefore
carries the whole remaining trajectory at once, in a frame anchored to
the present. Its RDM is a HAMMING distance — the fraction of future
positions at which two timepoints plan a different node — matching the
"overlap of locations" logic in the paper. The other three models are
cosine RDMs on their rate maps.

Settings that define the parameterisation (and are now written into
`key_analysis_stats.json['settings']`, because two runs differing only in
these are otherwise indistinguishable from the JSON alone):
N_CONDS_PER_CONFIG = 12 timepoints per configuration (30 bins = 30° each,
matching the human pipeline) and NUMBER_PHASE_NEURONS = 3.

TWO ANALYSES PER RECDAY
-----------------------
    1. `full_z`         — all configurations pooled; every off-diagonal
                          pair (within- and across-configuration).
    2. `across_halves`  — configurations recorded in TWO separate
                          sessions are split into those two sessions and
                          similarity is only ever computed across them.
                          Halves share no trials, so no within-session
                          autocorrelation can inflate the fit. Only
                          configurations with ≥2 source sessions qualify.

GROUP STATISTICS
----------------
Each recday's joint GLM is a standardised (z-scored) OLS; the per-recday β
for each model is carried to the group level and tested with a one-sided
one-sample t-test against zero across recdays, BH-FDR corrected across the
four models. Written to `key_analysis_stats.json`.

NOTE ON n: a "recday" is a RECORDING UNIT, not an animal — it is named
`{mouse}_{day1}_{day2}` and is two days that were spike-sorted together
(6 task configurations, 3 per day). The 8 recdays analysed here come from
5 animals:

    ah03 ×1, ah04 ×3, me08 ×1, me10 ×1, me11 ×2

so n = 8 recdays / 5 mice, and the group test treats recording DAYS, not
animals, as independent units.

These 8 are what the private Drive share provided — they are NOT the whole
dataset. The public release (https://osf.io/3d9r2/) has 25 combined ABCD
recdays from 7 mice; ab03 (×3) and ah07 (×3) are absent here entirely.
`scripts/download_rodent_ephys_data.py` fetches the missing 17 (~2.0 GB).

Before using them: OSF ships RAW recordings only, so the normalised 360-bin
view this analysis runs on has to be rebuilt from Neuron_raw + trialtimes for
the new recdays — and then for ALL recdays with the same function, otherwise
the preprocessing difference lines up with the mouse split and confounds the
group test. See the caveat at the top of the download script.

# Phase residualisation: per-cell OLS of firing rate against a within-state

#                    RSA in RSA_DSR_ROIs_simple.py. Removes the smooth
#                    first-harmonic phase but leaves higher harmonics.
#   'cosine_2h'   — 4 basis functions (adds sin, cos of 4πφ). Removes
#                    first + second harmonic. This is what we use here.
#                    Chosen empirically: the criterion was that the
#                    `phas` (Subgoal Progress) regressor is driven to a
#                    null effect in the group GLM. A bare 'cosine' basis
#                    leaves `phas` significant, because the rodent phase
#                    tuning (von Mises, κ = 3.33) is sharp enough to carry
#                    non-trivial 2nd-harmonic content. In humans the

#                    the phase component is subtracted, the cell's mean
#                    firing rate is preserved.
#   'categorical' — 3 boxcar indicators (early/middle/late). Tightest
#                    match to the 3-neuron structure of `phas`, but
#                    departs further from the human convention.
